Big brain time!

The future of computer mice!!!

We will soon see computer mice/mouses with built-in USB-stick/mini-HDD/SSD storage-space and with 2 USB-ports&USB-cables coming out of the computer mouse - so that you can easily transfer files (Cut/Copy/Paste) between different computers (or a computer and any USB-storage-port device):

This adds a contextual item in the right-click-menu/context-menu of the desktop of the OS - or it adds these options to an icon in the notifications area of your OS/linux-desktop-environment taskbar panel/applet/desktop-gadget!!! ðŸ˜®
And the computer mouse may even have 4 LED indicators: blue = on, operation, on standby, no filesharing; green (blinking) = active filesharing in progress (green, not blinking = filesharing completed successfully, switches to blue afterwards; yellow = some error message or faulty hardware, or unable to load drivers to establish connection; red = filesharing error after a green (blinking) or yellow LED got activated)!!! ðŸ¤”

P.S. There is also a USBoverEthernetInternet tech that had been very controversial due to online security risks, but has been available for many years now and also demonstrated on its respective website! ðŸ˜®ðŸ¤”
