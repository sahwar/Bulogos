# A Modest Proposal For An Extending Update to the Default Linux kernel filesystem-hierarchy, by ve4ernik@gmail.com :
 Add a built-in (&later backward-compatible, forwards-compatible, and even backported to older releases/versions/editions of the Linux kernel!) Linux kernel module that sets the user-preferred FHS/FSHS (LSB) - filesystem hierarchy (dir tree structure): 0 (default: default Linux FHS; UNIX/*NIX-compatible), 1 (borrowed from GoboLinux ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoboLinux ) & add ve4ernik website links, influenced by MS Windows self-contained directories/folders), 2 (same as 1) BUT with additional soft-linked(/hardlinked?/Linux-symlinked?) dirs to the default Linux FHS, and backup default-Linux-FHS dirs as they usually are - similar to system-protected (OS) files in the OS-folders 'win32'&'WoW64' dirs of MS Windows7(+) OS), 3 (new systemd-2020 user-management & /home/-dir management), 4 (user-programmed; including editable at pre-full-boot GRUB2-/etc.-CLI-menu), 5 (placeholder for non-systemd/systemd-free other initfreedom.org init-script (influenced by http://devuan.org , the systemd-less fork of Debian)...), 6 (same as 5) here, but with the 1) filesystem hierarchy), 7 (same as 5) but with the 2) filesystem hierarchy), 8-999999 = placeholders for user-specified, user-programmed init scripts & user-supplied custom/mod Linux filesystem hierarchies (different from the default Linux FHS)...)...
