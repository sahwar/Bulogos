[Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) officially offers you to download a FULL archive of ALL your tweets via

(clicking on your Twitter account icon on the top of the user-interface) ->
**Profile and Settings -> Settings and Privacy -> Account -> Content: Your Tweet archive -> _Download archive_**.

The archive will be sent as an email that gives you a hyperlink to download the .ZIP of the archive from twitter.com's web-servers.

Here are some 3rd-party software tools to do the same **or with more options**:
