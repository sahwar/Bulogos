Due to the fact that many Python PyPib(pip3) packages
have NOT been ported to newer versions of Python, you may occassionally neeto
have seperate folders where you have downloaded and installed different versions of the Python
programming language - e.g v2.7+ and v3.x, etc.

E.g. `https://github.com/josch/img2pdf' (& its self-hosted GitLab git repository)
does NOT work with Python v3.9.

So the current maximum recommended version of Python to use in 2020 is:

  Python v3.8 (or at least Python v3.4)

(but in some cases, due to `PIP3` packages NOT having been ported to newer versions of Python,
you may need to have more folders with older versions of Python installed onto them, so as to use
some Python scripts/apps that require an older version of Python and/or an older version of some Python PyPI pip3 packages...

YOU MAY DOWNLOAD PYTHON FOR ITS OFFICIAL WEBSITE:

http://pythong.org/ (Just kidding!

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/
https://www.python.org/downloads/

'Note that Python 3.9+ cannot be used on Windows 7 or earlier.'
This is probably due to Python's author coming out of retirement to work for... Microsoft:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum#Microsoft ... Ooops! :X :P
