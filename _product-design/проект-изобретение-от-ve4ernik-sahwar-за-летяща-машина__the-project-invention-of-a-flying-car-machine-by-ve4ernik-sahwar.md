DESCRIPTION: In the years 2019-2022+, ve4ernik-sahwar had the idea to make an invention which will be a flying-car and it will be made as a very big transparent/translucent sphere-ball made of many compartments, and with a seat and rubber handles extending from inside the exterior of the ball towards the middle/center, and the flying-machine will have 4-8 rotators like those of a modern (poat-2010) flying-car-like air-drone with propeller rotators within rings on several sides (but also with a safety net between the propeller rotating wings and the exterior of the ring which holds them to the base od the air-drone flying-machine... So ve4ernik's flying-machine will have transparent/rubber durable hits-absorbing sphare-ball shape, and it can fly to a height of up to 50-100 m and with a flying time of 30 min to 2-5 hours, using a petrol-based engine or some rechargeable electric-battery-based engine, and it will also include an emergency escape parachute (opening in 5 secs!) and big ball-like shoes for the legs of the human operator and also for the hands (to serve as hit-absorbing buffer when hitting the ground slowly or when hitting buildings or trees), and it will also have a hot-air-baloon attached to its base as an additional flying mechanism in case the main engine fails or the fuel runs out in mid-air or something else bad happens...
 This idea for a flying-car made by ve4ernik-sahwar was originally posted as a series of posts on the now-censor-deleted http://instagram.com/ve4ernik back in 2018-2021+... ve4ernik-sahwar has also researched the blueprint designs and photos and images of air-baloon dirigibles and some real spaceships by USA NASA and by Russia Roskosmos and by Europe's ESA and by SpaceX, BlueOrigin, Virgin Galactic, by PRC China, India, and by Japan, and also some sci-fi spaceships 3D-designed by artists and posted on http://cgsociety.org , http://deviantart.com , http://pixeljoint.net , and on http://sketchfab.com as well as featured on screenshots from articles about video games on issues of the Bulgarian-language video-gaming-journalism magazine http://pcmania.bg and from screenshots from various older or newer video-games, including designs of a literal flying ship in the shape of a ship and with hot-air-baloon dirigible top and rotating propellers for sideways and up/bottom navigation...
 
 Recently, ve4ernik-sahwar saw an article inside an advertizing brochure for a local pharmacy shop, and the article featured a similar invention to that by ve4ernik-sahwar described above BUT the invention in the article was only a rubber sphere-ball transparent vehicle with the human operator inside of it like in a hamster's wheel-cage and is only for land use or for use on water (similar to a safety air-balloon-like vest for floating on water in case of emergencies)... You can see the 2 pages of that article hyperlinked below for reference (the photos of the article were shot by ve4ernik-sahwar on 30-April-2022):
