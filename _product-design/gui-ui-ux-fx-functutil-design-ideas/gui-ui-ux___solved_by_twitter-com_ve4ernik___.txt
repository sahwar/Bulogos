As previously mentioned in other tweets, nothing more functional than the WIMP (windows--icons--menus--mouse-pointer-cursor GUI paradigm (with touchscreen/haptic+voice-control+machine-learning AI-assistant, and context-sensitive keyboard-monkey search-box/app+command-launcher added) can be invented... --- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)

The only viable alternatives as to GUI/UX are, as I listed before:
(1) guy with an Internet-connected AI-nanosupercomputer-microchip 'fused' with his bio-brain's natural human cognition/intelligence, like in Intelligence (2014 US TV series - https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2693776/ ), BUT privacy, hacking-susceptibility, and bio-harm make it unsuitable&undesirable...
(2) Kiva's interactive holographic-haptic multi-window + voice-controlled WIMP GUI from Megas XLR (2004-2005 US animated TV series, season 1, episode 1 at 1:31-5:00 video-timecode --- https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361201/ 
--- https://youtu.be/JQ8TfWyWmLY
(3) Ironman's voice-controlled semi-hardA.I. (Jarvis, later: Friday) machine-learning supercomputer assistant AND the interactive 3D-model virtual assistant machine-learning-AI woman (Cortana) from the Halo video-games - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortana_(Halo) )
(4) having a super-powered nanocomputer as a small cube/sphere/oval on a wristband on your hand (similar to (2)), which projects 3D holographic-haptic multi-window WIMP GUI + voice-control AI - on space or on any surface (preferably: flat surfaces) [MY personal favorite, but it's hard energy-battery- and holographic-projection-wise...)
(5) Google Glass-like computer-on-sunglasses shades (GUI projected on the shades and voice&eye/headbody-movement-controlled) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass
(6) Microsoft surface haptic+voice-controlled LCD+3D-holograms _on a table_ - for military-tactics/stock-exchange-markets/scientific-simulations/turn-based video-gaming/power-plant-maintenance purposes.
(7) lightweight desktop-environments for keyboard-hacktivist-monkeys, like OpenBox+lightweight text-configurable tiling&stacking GUI window managers (i3, etc.) PLUS a [context-menu/right-click-menu] text-searchbox apps/commands-launcher (e.g. Wox) and in-menu searcher (i.e. https://github.com/p-e-w/plotinus) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:XWinSys
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers
(8) some other novelty crap shoved your way...

You just _probably_ CAN'T invent anything better in terms of usability/functionality/KISS-principle, however much you try...
