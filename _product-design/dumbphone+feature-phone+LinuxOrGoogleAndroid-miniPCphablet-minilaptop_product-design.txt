(to paste in-page-embedded images here - with photos of classic dumbphones / feature phones, showcasing their looks...)
(and then to add my (sahwar/ve4ernik's additions to the list - especially some extra key mappings to the not-QWERTY keyboard, IME key,
Unicode-charmap pad/searchbar-app key, and a programmable key with an omnisearch bar, and numeric-mappings for accelerators that are mapped to a specific programmable key...)
(see also: the product-design blueprints of Google before they release their Google Pixel smartphones - the blueprints about the
modular-design smartphone with a removeable rechargable battery, and I would also add a USB port that is compatible with a multi-SATA-extension
to hook up up to 10 USB-devices/peripherals, and also up 10 SATA HDDs/SSDs, with each of the 10 USB-SATA-SATA hardware ports capable of supporting another such extension, thus
enabling one to hook up up to 10x10 (=100) extra HDDs/SSDs to a single ARMv6+/amd64 smartphone/tablet/phablet, etc.!!!)

etc.
