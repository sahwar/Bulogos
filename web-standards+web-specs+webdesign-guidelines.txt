Zen CSS garden...

+ this HTML5+CSS3+JavaScript-v6+-autocompletion-via-abbreviations tool/plug-in for text-editor apps (like Notepad++, Notepad2-mod, Notepad3, Notepadqq, Spacemacs, NeoVim, Emacsen, Cream Emacs/Vim, SublimeText2, CUDA Text, GitHub Atom, Adobe Brackets, BabelPad, etc. & for computer-programming/sofware-engineering IDEs) --- see also: the .php/.js script (hosted on my http://gist.github.org and also use SearchEverything to scan my PCs for those files...) written by Aleksandar Kamburov ( http://kamburov.net ) for me, by OmegaKO@animerulezzz.org & modified by me ( https://github.com/sahwar/Bulogos ) to do the same as https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/ does - but localized to the Bulgarian language (you can also do your own forks if you don't like my Bulgarian abbreviations of the HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript tags/keywords, etc.)!):

Emmet — the essential toolkit for web-developers
Emmet is a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow:

Play demoTry it yourself
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
“Expand Abbreviation” (Tab key)
“Next Edit Point” (Ctrl+Alt+→)
“Previous Edit Point” (Ctrl+Alt+←)
“Balance” (Ctrl+D)
“Select Next Item” (Shift+Ctrl+.)
“Select Previous Item” (Shift+Ctrl+,)
“Toggle Comment” (Ctrl+/)
▶ Watch demo
Basically, most text editors out there allow you to store and re-use commonly used code chunks, called “snippets”. While snippets are a good way to boost your productivity, all implementations have common pitfalls: you have to define the snippet first and you can’t extend them in runtime.

Emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level: you can type CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation. Emmet is developed and optimised for web-developers whose workflow depends on HTML/XML and CSS, but can be used with programming languages too.

Start learning Emmet with the abbreviation syntax and available actions.
