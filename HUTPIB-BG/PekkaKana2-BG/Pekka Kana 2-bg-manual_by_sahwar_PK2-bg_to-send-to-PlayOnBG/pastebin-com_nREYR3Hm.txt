Best image viewers (image viewing apps; the entries in the list are in NO particular order whatsoever!) for MS Windows and Linux:

[01] http://goo.gl/zkexv3 = Imagine (Very Good Image & Animation Viewer for Microsoft Windows, developed by a (Soth)Korean programmer; multilingual; I love that it uses the FAMFAMFAM.com icon set! Multilingual.)
[02] http://goo.gl/f87Y4E = nomacs (a surpisingly good image & animation viewer; it's licensed under the GNU GPLv3 and is fucking awesome! It's available for MS Windows, Linux and even Mac OS! I FUCKING LOVE THE FRAMELESS MODE OF THIS IMAGE EDITOR, it's a godsend!!! Developed by Markus Diem, Stefan Fiel, Florian Kleber, et al.; Multilingual.)
[03] http://goo.gl/QidhYX = ImageGlass (for MS Windows (requires Microsoft's .NET Framework 4.0+) and maybe Linux via Wine+Mono?; GNU GPL and very well-designed GUI; multilingual. Alternative link: https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass. )
[04] http://mirageiv.sourceforge.net/ (Free software; I like this as an image viewer for Linux!)
[05] https://sourceforge.net/projects/gqview/ = GQview (Nice FOSS image viewer for Linux, *BSD, Mac OS. There's also a Win32 port for MS Windows: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gqview-win/ )
[06] https://sourceforge.net/projects/geeqie/ = Geeqie (fork of GQview mentioned above; also open-source; looks pretty good. Alternative URLs:
http://www.geeqie.org/ & https://github.com/BestImageViewer/geeqie )
[07] https://sourceforge.net/projects/gthumb/ = GThumb (for Linux and *BSD; multilingual. Better than EoG (Eye of GNOME) / EoM (Eye of MATE) IMHO, especially due to the neat in-app thumbnail previews! open-source)
[08] https://sourceforge.net/projects/imgv/ = ImgV (looks great, haven't tested it myself though so give it a try if you like its description over at its website: http://imgv.sourceforge.net/ ; open-source)
[09] https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcomix/ = MComix (A fork of the Comix comic-book-images image reader/viewer; looks great for fans of comics!)
[10] https://sourceforge.net/projects/comical/ = Comical (another cool open-source comic images viewer!)
[11] http://www.xnview.com/en/ = XnView by Pierre-e Gougelet (Freeware for MS Windows, extremely good; It was my top favorite before I found nomacs & Imagine. It still shares my number 1 spot along with those 2 other viewers. The developer is a fucking genius because he reads EVERY bug report / suggestion posted on the official forums of the app and ACTUALLY listens to the users of the app (tip for aspiring programmers (FOSS/volunteer or commercial/paid): this is how it should be done, folks!)! There's also a beta-quality cross-platform rewrite of it called XnViewMP by the same developer.)
[12] http://www.irfanview.com/ = IrfanView by Irfan Skiljan (This is perhaps the modern grandfather of all the best image viewers ever, and, unsurprisingly, it's still a GREAT image viewer! It also supports quite a lot of plug-ins. Freeware for MS Windows (a 64-bit version is also available).)
[13] http://siyanpanayotov.com/project/viewnior/ = Viewnior (a GTK+-based nice and simple free and open-source image viewer for GNU/Linux by the Bulgarian developer Siyan Panayotov; Alternative link: https://github.com/xsisqox/Viewnior )
[14] http://lxde.sourceforge.net/gpicview/ = GPicView (extremely minimalist GTK+-based open-source image viewer for Linux, default for the LXDE desktop environment for Linux)
[15] http://www.xiles.net/ = nexusimage (NexusImage by Xiles.net a.k.a. Junghoon Noh, a South-Korean software engineer)

https://sourceforge.net/projects/comictoepub/

P.S. What image viewers are my PERSONAL favorites? Easy. These:
nomacs (the FRAMELESS MODE is THE BEST!!!), Imagine Image & Animation Viewer, XnView, ImageGlass, IrfanView, Mirage (Linux), GThumb (Linux), and GPicView (Linux). The rest are either too lame or not to my taste, or just too specialized (e.g. MComix & CDisplayEx are great, but are mostly for comic file-formats!).
