Some ideas to improve http://github.com/jappix/jappix even though that project is kinda abandoned but is still mostly
functional for setting up your own personal XMPP/Jabber (  ) node with a GUI like Mebbit.com-IRC or PidginIM!!!

2. add the http://discord.com-like emoji-entering searchbar pop-up menu... like pidginIM-emoji, pidginIM-twitter, Psi+/Gajim/etc. ; etc.

SIDENOTE:

http://blackbox.net - MS Windows - alternative desktop shells for Microsoft Windows - similar to FluxBox for Linux/UNIX/*NIX/UNIX-like OSs/Linux distro-OSs...
PuppyLinux GUI-library & EasyOS Debian-/Ubuntu-/LinuxMint/MX-Linux/AntiX-Linux-based edition, etc.

Conversations
An encrypted, user friendly XMPP instant messaging client optimized for mobile
New in version 2.8.5+fcr
* Reduce echo during calls on some devices
* Fix login when passwords contains special characters
* Play dial and busy tones on speaker during video calls
Easy to use, reliable, battery friendly. With built-in support for images, group chats and e2e encryption.

Design principles:

* Be as beautiful and easy to use as possible without sacrificing security or privacy
* Rely on existing, well established protocols
* Do not require a Google Account or specifically Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)
* Require as few permissions as possible

Features:

* End-to-end encryption with either OMEMO or OpenPGP
* Sending and receiving images
* Encrypted audio and video calls (DLTS-SRTP)
* Intuitive UI that follows Android Design guidelines
* Pictures / Avatars for your Contacts
* Syncs with desktop client
* Conferences (with support for bookmarks)
* Address book integration
* Multiple accounts / unified inbox
* Very low impact on battery life

Conversations makes it very easy to create an account on the conversations.im server. Using that server comes with an annual fee of 8 Euro after a 6 month trial period. However Conversations will work with any other XMPP server as well. A lot of XMPP servers are run by volunteers and are free of charge.

XMPP Features:

Conversations works with every XMPP server out there. However XMPP is an extensible protocol. These extensions are standardized as well in so called XEP’s. Conversations supports a couple of those to make the overall user experience better. There is a chance that your current XMPP server does not support these extensions. Therefore to get the most out of Conversations you should consider either switching to an XMPP server that does or - even better - run your own XMPP server for you and your friends.

These XEPs are - as of now:

* XEP-0065: SOCKS5 Bytestreams (or mod_proxy65). Will be used to transfer files if both parties are behind a firewall (NAT).
* XEP-0163: Personal Eventing Protocol for avatars
* XEP-0191: Blocking command lets you blacklist spammers or block contacts without removing them from your roster.
* XEP-0198: Stream Management allows XMPP to survive small network outages and changes of the underlying TCP connection.
* XEP-0280: Message Carbons which automatically syncs the messages you send to your desktop client and thus allows you to switch seamlessly from your mobile client to your desktop client and back within one conversation.
* XEP-0237: Roster Versioning mainly to save bandwidth on poor mobile connections
* XEP-0313: Message Archive Management synchronize message history with the server. Catch up with messages that were sent while Conversations was offline.
* XEP-0352: Client State Indication lets the server know whether or not Conversations is in the background. Allows the server to save bandwidth by withholding unimportant packages.
* XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload allows you to share files in conferences and with offline contacts. Requires an additional component on your server.

    Permissions
        modify or delete the contents of your shared storage
        Allows the app to write the contents of your shared storage.
        read the contents of your shared storage
        Allows the app to read the contents of your shared storage.
        read your contacts
        Allows the app to read data about your contacts stored on your phone, including the frequency with which you've called, emailed, or communicated in other ways with specific individuals. This permission allows apps to save your contact data, and malicious apps may share contact data without your knowledge.
        have full network access
        Allows the app to create network sockets and use custom network protocols. The browser and other applications provide means to send data to the internet, so this permission is not required to send data to the internet.
        view network connections
        Allows the app to view information about network connections such as which networks exist and are connected.
        prevent phone from sleeping
        Allows the app to prevent the phone from going to sleep.
        run at startup
        Allows the app to have itself started as soon as the system has finished booting. This can make it take longer to start the phone and allow the app to slow down the overall phone by always running.
        control vibration
        Allows the app to control the vibrator.
        ask to ignore battery optimizations
        Allows an app to ask for permission to ignore battery optimizations for that app.
        access approximate location (network-based) only in the foreground
        This app can get your location based on network sources such as cell towers and Wi-Fi networks, but only when the app is in the foreground. These location services must be turned on and available on your phone for the app to be able to use them.
        access precise location only in the foreground
        This app can get your exact location only when it is in the foreground. These location services must be turned on and available on your phone for the app to be able to use them. This may increase battery consumption.
        view Wi-Fi connections
        Allows the app to view information about Wi-Fi networking, such as whether Wi-Fi is enabled and name of connected Wi-Fi devices.
        run foreground service
        Allows the app to make use of foreground services.
        request install packages
        Allows an application to request installation of packages.

        This app can take pictures and record videos using the camera at any time.
        record audio
        This app can record audio using the microphone at any time.
        pair with Bluetooth devices
        Allows the app to view the configuration of the Bluetooth on the phone, and to make and accept connections with paired devices.
        change your audio settings
        Allows the app to modify global audio settings such as volume and which speaker is used for output.
        android.permission.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT
