24_feature-requests_on_howto-improve-Rakuten-Viber-IM+VoIP+filesharing-chat-app-for-smartphones+desktops-OSs.txt

[I, ve4ernik/sahwar <ikurdov10@gmail.com>, wasn't paid a single USD-dollar to write all of these suggestions to improve the Rakuten Viber chat-app for desktop operating systems (e.g. Microsoft Windows 7/8/8.1/10/11) or for operating systems for other devices like Google Android OS. I composed all of this merely as a testament to my tastes in application-software QA (quality-assurance)... The team behind Viber is welcome to use these suggestions FOR FREE, without having to pay me anything for borrowing these ideas or implementing them in newer version of the Viber chat app for desktop, the Viber chat app for smartphones/smart-devices, and the possible future HTML5 Web/webapp version of the Viber app...]

NOTE1: Where all feature-request ideas mentioned below concern individual chatlogs with individual contacts/users, the same also applies to adding the mentioned requested features to the conference chatlogs with multiple people).

NOTE2: You are free to submit github.com git pull-requests for this .txt file or email me your edited version of this file...

Import all messeges from all/specific chatlogs as individual .html files packed as a .zip compressed archive [in case you didn't sync chatlogs history via auto-sync over an active Internet connection, or if you have previously disabled Viber for Desktop & have reactivated it & want to manually sync via an offline .zip generated on Viber app for smartphone/smart-devices

7. Clicking on the (i) button within individual chatlogs with a specific contact gives you a long list of menu items, which must have a visual side scrollbar added to it

8. The same (i) menu from 7. should have these menu items added to it:
* Export complete chatlog [with all backbuffer messages up to&including the 1st one+system messeges from Viber app] as datetime-stamped .html (html5, self-contained with base64-coded binary files, OR html5, plus "_files" sidecar folder with all binary&other files within, OR self-contained .mht/.mhtml, OR as self-contained WebArchive .warc file)

Add link in (i)-button within individual chatlogs with a specific contact gives you a long list of menu items, to the options added via 6. mentioned above.

9. The cog-wheel hamburger-menu in the upper right should have an added option to sync all chatlogs with Viber webservers, an a green/yellow/red visual indicator on top (with a onhover tooltip hint) should indicate that & clicking on it should refresh all chatlogs if an active Internet connection is present...

10. Add hide/unhide buttons to both sidebars in Viber for Desktop app, and add a button to both such sidebars to move each one from right-to-left and/or from left-to-right (you can even have both sidebars on either side). Also add horizontal scrollbars to both sidebars.

13. Allow basic CommonMark.org markup (bold/italic/underlined/strikethrough/etc.) in individual chatlog with a specific user/contact (hyperlinks are still converted to clickable links when posted as-is), but all that is converted to .html markup in case of export of individual/all chatlog/s...

14. Adding 13. means to add 11. as 'Copy all [unformatted plaintext as-is seen] or as 'Copy all [formatted, commonmark markup]' (same for 'Paste').

15. Viber for Desktop allows you to right-click & copy contact name/tel-number(/email) of the chat-buddy contact from the current chatlog, it should also allow you to rename said contact for IRC-style text-messages feature & to revert to original contact name/tel-number/name+tel-in-brackets/name+/or-email...
