I am putting the .TTF (**TrueType** - Windows-, Linux-, macOS-, Android-compatible font files) from https://fontstruct.com/fontstructors/27969/sahwar in this folder.

The .glyphs source files of the fonts can be edited by using the commercial GlyphsApp (for macOS 10.9+ ONLY) BUT if you make a free account on FontStruct.com, you can freely clone my fonts from there and edit them in the free online HTML5 FontStruct matrix-fonts editor.
