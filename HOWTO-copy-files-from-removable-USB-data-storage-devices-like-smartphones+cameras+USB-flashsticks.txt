HOWTO-copy-files-from-removable-USB-data-storage-devices-like-smartphones+cameras+USB-flashsticks.txt

DO NOT _MOVE_ the files via Ctrl+X (Cut) but 
use Ctrl+C (Copy) and Ctrl+V (Paste) to copy
the files (especially if they are photos, videos,
images, etc.), because there sometimes appears to happen
disk-errors and I/O errors and data corruption, or loose USB cable,
which causes data loss, data corruption, or hardware failures.

This is why MS Windowd has the 'Safely remove USB removable media'
feature for USB-connections despite USB being a hotpluggable remive-while-operating=okay
technology, and why Linux possibly executes this automatically.

After successful copying of the files, it is okay to do data-integrity verification via using hadh algorithms that have calculated tye SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-1024, and RSA, etc. hash checksums of the original files
and compare those en-masse (batch processing) with the copied files.
This is also used by many Linux distros to verify the intrgrity of downloaded liveCD/DVD/USB-flashstick .ido images, .AppImage's, etc.
