## Original idea for an open-source CLI/GUI/Web speech-synthesis app for computer pronunciation of texts in the contemporary Bulgarian language ##

Оригинална идея за програма от типа гласов/речев(и) синтезатор, за компютърно произношение на текстове, написани на съвременния български език, с лиценз на свободен софтуер с отворен код (и с платена версия с малко добавки).

I've now added a more thorough explanation below (**This _IS NOT_ the same as in my .txt files, that is pasted in the other Roman-numeral sections after I.!!!**).

**I. 7 core speech-synthesis subsystems/'engines' included with `govoritelbg-ss`:**

**1)** An engine which parses input text, applies a syllable-separation algorithm (several flavors to select from via `--some-argument/flag-here` option, one of them is this great syllable-seperation [method]() ), then matches the separated syllables to a JSON-file linking to human-speaker-pronounced speech-segment-recordings of the most-common syllables of the contemporary Bulgarian language, then concatenates (merges) all the text's syllables' native-human-speaker-pronounced syllable-recordings pre-supplied-by-the-app audio-files via `ffmpeg`/`libav` and generates the output file with the pronunciation which is then played to speakers (DEFAULT engine!).
NOTE: To support multiple languages & speaker-voice datasets, there will be more `--arguments` to select language and speaker-voice dataset before generating&playing the output audio-file, but the Bulgarian language is the default one to be used for the app. Also note that there will be several configuration files (JSON/.config/.conf/YAML/custom-txt-based formats) like those of the NVDA screen-reader app bundled with the app, and with a custom/user copy of those for the user to fine-tune the app before running it if the user doesn't like the default settings&configs of the app.

**2)** Same as 1 above but instead of syllable concatenation, we use an MBROLA-based diphones human-speaker-voice audio-recordings files being concatenated (merged).

**3)** Same as method 2 above but with syllable concatenation (&whitespace/pauses-between-words/strings) applied before the concatenation of MBROLA(-like) diphones.

**4)** Same as method 1, but we use speaker-voice dataset(s) which are human-speech recordings of the IPA phonemes (X-SAMPA/Z-SAMPA/IPA/extIPA list of the phonmes, in a JSON file listing all these phonemes and their recording audio-files), with the speaker-voice datasets being at least 3-5 supplied to choose from (a few others will be in the commercial/paid version of the app).

**5)** Some computer-generated worse-sounding speech-synthesis which is programmatic-only (WITHOUT using better-sounding concatenation of pre-recorded human-voice datasets of syllables/phonemes/whole words/etc.). See for ideas: the _Toshko2_ Bulgarian-speech-synthesis app.

**7)** (some other speech-synthesis engine/subsystem to be freely supplied/plugged-in/integrated into the ap as supplied by the end-user).

**NOTE:** There will also be a `--argument` to use several dictionary datasets of pre-recorded human-speaker-voice-pronounced speech audio-file recordings of _whole-words & whole-phrases_ for even better-sounding output audio-file generated by this app (a user can also change (replace) those files OR supply a new, user-generated (manually recorded&edited) dictionary of such speaker-voice datasets.

**NOTE2:** One of the config files will have NVDA-like JSON-based instructions on how to pronounce punctuation and basic post-generation speech-filters for e.g. speech-quality shifting for emphasis, questions, exclamations, quotations within the text, etc.).

**NOTE3:** The end-user may produce his/her own language&specific human-speaker-voice audio-recodings speech-segments (&hundreds-of-files-or-more dictionary of whole-word&whole-phrase audio-file recordings) to use with the app via another `--argument` if they don't like the default&supplied human-speaker(s) dataset audio-files used in the concatenation for the generation of the final output speech-synthesis audio-file.

_PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE(S) FOR WRITING THE APP:_ Rust, C/C++, Python3, Lua, Go, bash shell-scripting (for ffmpeg/libav use?), Perl+PCRE, Vala, FreePascal/Delphi/LazaursIDE, etc., even PHP is sorta OK-ish...

_INPUT FILES:_ .txt and other text formats (maybe use `pandoc` and HTML5-parser plug-in for cleanup-to-plaintext, or maybe also have an option to change pronunciations based on those <something>substring or string</something> tags...).

_OUTPUT FILES:_ .wav, .mp3, .ogg, .m4a, .flac

_TO CONSIDER:_ All pre-recorded human-voice-speaker dataset recordings files SHOULD be in the same audio fileformat, with the SAME basic audio-file characteristics (e.g. 44kHZ, 20Hz-20kHz, 8-bit/16-bit/32-bit floating, lossless or lossy filetype/recording, with those of similar type being of approximately the same short audio-duration/length).
All audio-files of each dataset should be those of the voice/speech of a single human (with basic bio-sex&bio-age&approx. geographical-dialect characteristics information) for optimal results!!!

**SUMMARY:** The main original idea is _the **concatenation** (via `ffmpeg`/`libav`) of bundled (supplied with the app) **pre-recorded audio-files containing recordings of real speech segments of human-speaker(s)' real voice** (in a normal/'flat' tone, maybe also add `--argument` for a sub-speaker-voice dataset of a different speech quality), with (optional/mandatory) **syllable-segmentation-algorithm(s) parsing** done beforehand, and with **optional post-generating speech audio-filters (e.g. language-specific orthography-to-orthoepy differences, etc.) applied** & outputted to a second generated resulting audio-file_.

_Syllables (syllable patterns (CVV, VCV, etc.) with all combinations of all corresponding language-specific phonemes - forming the syllable), diphones (~2 phones flowing together in connected speech), and (ext)IPA/X-SAMPA/Z-SAMPA phomenic/phonological phonemes_.

This is all in order to produce SOMEWHAT better-sounding speech-synthesis results than those of entirely programmatically-generated speech-synthesis engines which sound too robotic. The whole app `$ govoritelbg-ss` is about SIMPLE, QUICK & DIRTY speech synthesis of texts (mostly in the contemporary Bulgarian language with with ~45 phonemes in its orthoepy standardized contemporary variant which is parallel to the standard contemporary (semi-)formal written Bulgarian).

Making a speech-synthesis engine that emulates the whole human tract/speech organs is too cumbersome and complex, while speech-synthesis engines which are entirely programmatic-only sound TOO robotic, while we are aiming at a more natural-sounding result which is UNDERSTANDABLE to native-language human listeners (despite still being sorta/somewhat robotic/strung-together-sounds-sounding).

Other existing speech-synthesis engines (including for contemporary Bulgarian speech) use sorta similar techniques and algorithms, BUT NOT exactly as this one & are somewhat limited for our use (CLI&GUI-for-Linux-Windows-macOS & Web & Android) and ARE NOT open-source, that's why we're making this one!!! `GovoritelBG-ss` may find use by Google for its Google Translate website (for the Bulgarian speech-synthesis core(s)/feature).

## WE ARE LOOKING FOR PROGRAMMERS TO CODE THIS APP with collaboration with the author of the idea for this speech-synthesis app!! Please apply now to this potentially very-handy&useful open-source software project! ##
