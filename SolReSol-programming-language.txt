The SolReSol (SolReSoLuna subvariant) programming language is just the name
of a hypothetical programming language based on C/C++,
C#, Java, Python3+, Julia, Rust, Go, JavaScript v6+, R, and Scheme (variant of Lisp), etc.

It was named in honor of an old unrequited love of @sahwar / ve4ernik ( https://github.com/sahwar/Bulogos ):

@sahwar / ve4ernik no longer begs for anyone to stay and doesn't chase women much.
He is fine with dying alone and forgotten and childless and without a woman.
For he is sorta enlightened and doesn't care much anymore anyway... everything dies and everything ends...

Here is a calming Daoist quote with Zen Buddhism undertones (though it doesn't include the overcomplexity of contemporary high-tech consumerist money-driven globalized mass mainstream society):
Ако си чист, спокоен и непринуден, Небето ще осигури време за теб.
Ако си скромен, умерен и дисциплиниран, земята ще произведе богатство за теб.
- Даоски текст "Хуайнандзи“
If you are clear, calm, and uncontrived, Heaven will provide a time for you. 
If you are modest, frugal, and disciplined, earth will produce wealth for you.

- Daoist text "Huainanzi"

In the final analysis,
philosophy speaks for itself without words,
and almost no action is needed on your part...
You are just mostly fine with death & life, regardless of what happens and how...
That is the final message.
