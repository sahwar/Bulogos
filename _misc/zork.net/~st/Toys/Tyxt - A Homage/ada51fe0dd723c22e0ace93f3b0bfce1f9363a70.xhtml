		<p>A large painting in a gilded frame depicts a greenish blob surrounded by blue: A map, but not of any continent or landmass you've ever seen. In contrast to the rough-edged, ill-defined greenery are two perfect, white outlines, a square and a circle. You blink as you realise these depict the library and the planetarium. Where the rocky peak towers behind those two buildings on the island, the map has a smaller red circle.</p><p>Below the map, a small plaque reads simply, “Tower Rotation”.</p><p><a href="7965bc7f18b10cf0037084d11612bb0cf5ebf5b6.xhtml">Look around the Library</a>.</p>
