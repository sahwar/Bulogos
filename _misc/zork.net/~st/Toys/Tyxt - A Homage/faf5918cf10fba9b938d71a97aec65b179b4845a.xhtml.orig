		<p>You stand upon a brick causeway that winds its way from the library to what was once a rocky islet, but is now a sturdy brick-and-concrete cylinder a good hundred metres from the main part of the island. Against all probability, the terminus of the causeway is supporting a great, grimy yellow rocketship.</p><p>Currently the ship is inactive, but you can see a power line emerging from some way down the island, passing over a number of pylons and connecting to the side of the rocketship. Beside the causeway where you happen to be standing, one of the pylons seems to have a ladder attached to it.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="461e346546786911a5de4149113b560bdba18e54.xhtml">Return to the main island</a>,<br></br> <a href="249c6d6b00a65fb30f14e1e839cae95982e465eb.xhtml">Climb the pylon</a> or<br></br> <a href="6c73b6331c48f31a8078b8ff8e3d247f0cc26124.xhtml">Investigate the rocketship</a>.</p>
