		<p>A fireplace nestles snugly in this wall, soot and ash coating the floor and speckling the walls. The most remarkable thing about this fireplace is that it is situated on an island that is both filled with evidence of advanced human civilisation and far too small to actually contain one. Much less remarkably, although still worthy of note, it's a little larger you'd have expected.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="86b8b105766bdd98bde5f2fd75969a78923ab094.xhtml">Squeeze yourself into the fireplace</a> or<br></br> <a href="7965bc7f18b10cf0037084d11612bb0cf5ebf5b6.xhtml">Look around the Library</a>.</p>
