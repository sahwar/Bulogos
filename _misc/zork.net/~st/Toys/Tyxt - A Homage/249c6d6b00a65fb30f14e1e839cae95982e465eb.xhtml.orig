		<p>From the top of the power pylon, you can see a long way - miles of featureless water all the way to the horizon. A little closer to hand, a heavy duty power line approaches from the left, enters then emerges from a small metal box, then extends off to the right. The power line is out of your reach (probably a good thing, really), but you could operate the controls on the box, if there were any.</p><p><a href="faf5918cf10fba9b938d71a97aec65b179b4845a.xhtml">Return to the causeway</a>.</p>
