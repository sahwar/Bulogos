		<p>You ascend to the platform, leaning occasionally on the smart brass railing that surrounds it. This would make a great lookout, observation deck, or picnic area, except that the view of the island is obstructed by the domed Planetarium, and there’s nothing worth looking at towards the sea. Also, it’s almost entirely occupied by two enormous, rust-yellowed gears - one buried up to the axle in the platform’s surface, the other resting against it. There are no levers, controls, buttons, or other machinery, leaving you to assume that this is some mad sculptor’s impenetrably concise comment on something. Tapping the vertical gear with your knuckle makes a dull, hollow sound, confirming your suspicions.</p><p>The stair behind you descends to the promenade, and then continues to the dock.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="2ccec601d04824b5aa97cee5733f2721f7bc4058.xhtml">Return to the promenade</a> or<br></br> <a href="bf71305b1b806f86b95243527b313ae5fded4dd2.xhtml">Descend to the dock</a>.</p>
