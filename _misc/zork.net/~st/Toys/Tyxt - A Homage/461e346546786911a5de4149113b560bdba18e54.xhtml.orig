		<p>You stand at the summit of the main part of the island, not counting the inaccessible rocky pinnacle high above you. Here stands another large granite building, this one square and squat like a Parthenon only much smaller. Although the door is open, the interior lighting is no match for the blazing sunlight and you can only glimpse rectangular shapes that might be bookshelves inside. The building also has a huge, open book engraved above the doorway, so you feel safe in assuming it's some kind of library.</p><p>Nearby, you can see the psuedo-classical columns and domed roof of the Planetarium, a row of logs leading down to the promenade, a sort of brick causeway leading around behind the library to destinations unknown, and a narrow path that leads down through the trees to the tip of the island. At the near end of the path is a small bowl filled with water, on a pedestal.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="50d08c8d9bb8901c2833d8fae62d0dea842af5d4.xhtml">Enter the domed Planetarium</a>,<br></br> <a href="2ccec601d04824b5aa97cee5733f2721f7bc4058.xhtml">Follow the log path to the promenade</a>,<br></br> <a href="7965bc7f18b10cf0037084d11612bb0cf5ebf5b6.xhtml">Enter the library</a>,<br></br> <a href="faf5918cf10fba9b938d71a97aec65b179b4845a.xhtml">Explore the brick causeway</a> or<br></br> <a href="196848b606e33de95436f42544b790ddd7db33d3.xhtml">Examine the bowl</a>.</p>
