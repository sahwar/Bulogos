		<p>The rough trail you are on runs in a straight line from the sparse, classical Library at the peak of the island, through a scattered forest down to a sandy beach at the island's tip, just visible through the trees. Here, about mid-way down, there stands a very small brick shed, just large enough to frame a heavy wooden door. Either this is the entrance to some larger, underground structure, or it's the world's sturdiest outhouse.</p><p><a href="196848b606e33de95436f42544b790ddd7db33d3.xhtml">Hike up to the bowl</a>.</p>
