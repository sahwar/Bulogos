		<p>A promenade stretches along the edge of the island here. Above the dock, but below the summit of the island, it offers a magnificent view over the ocean - which would be more interesting if there were a single visual feature more than a few yards offshore. Out from the lee of the island, you can feel a gentle sea-breeze ruffling your hair.</p><p>At one end of the promenade, a small set of stairs will take you down to the dock, or up to some kind of mechanically-obsessed sculpture. At the other end, a series of logs forms a pathway up to the rest of the island - the closest feature is a little dome-roofed circular structure made from granite, complete with carved columns all the way around. Beyond that you can see a squarish sort of structure that also has stone columns, while in other directions you can see a forest, and an enormous rocky spire with a huge metallic cylinder on top.</p><p>To your surprise, you see a piece of paper fluttering about in the breeze.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="bf71305b1b806f86b95243527b313ae5fded4dd2.xhtml">Wander over to the stairs</a>,<br></br> <a href="db2e6f049816fbf858ac2ed42214cbcc13306ffc.xhtml">Climb up to the giant gears</a>,<br></br> <a href="50d08c8d9bb8901c2833d8fae62d0dea842af5d4.xhtml">Enter the domed Planetarium</a>,<br></br> <a href="0b75325ba5e615862c660a5760389f7248c44bba.xhtml">Pick up the paper</a> or<br></br> <a href="461e346546786911a5de4149113b560bdba18e54.xhtml">Follow the log path</a>.</p>
