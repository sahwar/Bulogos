		<p>Between the Library forecourt and the rest of the island, an ornamental granite bowl sits on a matching pedestal, filled almost to the brim with water. Inside the bowl rests a model sailing-ship, not floating but sitting sadly on the bottom with only the tips of her masts above water. Four lamp-like objects stand on each side of the path, small metal cubes with each side about the size of your palm, raised four or five feet off the ground by thin metal rods. Each of the cubes displays a shape, glowing red: a leaf, a bug, a snake, an arrow, an anchor, an eye, a flamingo, a cross.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="461e346546786911a5de4149113b560bdba18e54.xhtml">Walk up to the library</a> or<br></br> <a href="84e0e1c5f1db7209784711fc674888b71b85ae45.xhtml">Follow the path downhill</a>.</p>
