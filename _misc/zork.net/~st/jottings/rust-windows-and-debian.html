<p>I&rsquo;ve used Debian Linux
(specifically Debian Testing,
the rolling, regularly-updated version)
as my standard desktop environment for years,
I&rsquo;m very happy with it
and comfortable developing software for it.
But in the Rust community,
it&rsquo;s considered polite
to make sure your libraries and tools also support Windows:
it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html">tier-1</a> platform for the Rust compiler,
anything that might wind up in Firefox needs Windows support,
and so forth.
Not least,
<a href="https://github.com/retep998">retep998</a> has put a huge effort into
making Rust work nicely on Windows,
including patiently explaining Windows quirks
to an often POSIX-centric audience,
and it would be a shame to disappoint him.</p>
<p>Therefore,
when I set out to write a library that involved path handling,
I decided to make sure it worked on Windows as well as Linux.
The actual path-handling turned out to be rather knotty,
as most cross-platform code tends to be,
but cross-compiling was much easier than I expected.</p>
<h1 id="building-an-executable">Building an executable<a class="headerlink" href="rust-windows-and-debian.html#building-an-executable" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Unlike many other compilers
(such as <code>gcc</code>),
every copy of the Rust compiler can compile code
for any supported target platform,
so the actual &ldquo;compilation&rdquo; part is easy.
Where normally you&rsquo;d run something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>cargo build
</pre></div>


<p>&hellip;instead you can run:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
</pre></div>


<p>and you&rsquo;ll get a proper, working&hellip;</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>error[E0463]: can&#39;t find crate for `std`
  |
  = note: the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target may not be installed
</pre></div>


<p>&hellip;OK, it doesn&rsquo;t actually work.
While Rust will happily compile your crate
for whatever target you want,
actually making a working program
also requires a copy of the standard library
built for that target.</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;m using my <a href="https://gitlab.com/Screwtapello/rustbud">rustbud</a> tool
to manage my Rust toolchain,
I just mention it in my <code>rustbud-spec.toml</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[toolchain.optional]</span>
<span class="na">rust-std</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">[&quot;x86_64-pc-windows-gnu&quot;]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>&hellip;and then every time I activate that environment,
I&rsquo;ll have the Windows version of the stdlib available.
If you&rsquo;re using <a href="https://rustup.rs/">rustup</a> instead
(as most people probably are),
this is the command you&rsquo;ll need:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
</pre></div>


<p>And now when we build our program&hellip;</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">error</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">linking</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="err">`</span><span class="n">gcc</span><span class="err">`</span> <span class="n">failed</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">exit</span> <span class="n">code</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

</pre></div>


<p>&hellip;it still doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>When cross-compiling,
the compiler is only part of the picture.
The compiler takes your source code
and turns it into machine-code
that the target CPU can execute,
but the linker takes all that machine-code
and bundles it together into an executable
that the target operating system can load and run.
In order to produce Windows programs,
we need a linker that understands the Windows <code>.exe</code> file format.</p>
<p>Luckily,
Debian provides packages for the whole <code>gcc</code> toolchain
built to cross-compile Windows executables,
including the linker we need.
You can install it with:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>sudo apt install mingw-w64
</pre></div>


<p>&hellip;and then you&rsquo;ll have a program named <code>x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc</code>
which is exactly the one Rust wants.
Unfortunately,
as the previous error suggested,
Rust tries to use <code>gcc</code> instead of this new name,
so it&rsquo;s still going to break.
To tell Rust which linker to use,
add the following to <code>~/.cargo/config</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]</span>
<span class="na">linker</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(If you set <code>$CARGO_HOME</code> to point at some other location,
you can put this config file there instead,
but if you put it in the default location
it&rsquo;ll work regardless of what <code>$CARGO_HOME</code> is set to.)</p>
<p>Now we can finally build an executable for Windows!</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
   Compiling windows-demo v0.1.0 <span class="o">(</span>file:///home/st/windows-demo<span class="o">)</span>
    Finished dev <span class="o">[</span>unoptimized + debuginfo<span class="o">]</span> target<span class="o">(</span>s<span class="o">)</span> in <span class="m">1</span>.36 secs
$ ls target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/*.exe
target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/windows-demo.exe
</pre></div>


<p>But&hellip; now that we&rsquo;ve built it,
how do we even know it works?</p>
<h1 id="testing">Testing<a class="headerlink" href="rust-windows-and-debian.html#testing" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Testing Windows software ultimately requires
a copy of Windows to test against,
but running a full Windows VM
can take a lot of CPU power and RAM,
not to mention the awkwardness
of getting your program into the VM
and the test-results back out.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s not Real Windows,
testing with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>
can be a fast and easy way
to shake out the most glaring portability problems,
and it&rsquo;s pretty easy to get it going:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install Wine itself,
   with support for 64-bit Windows
   (since we&rsquo;re working with x86_64 here):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>sudo apt install wine wine64
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Install the package that teaches Linux to use Wine when trying to run .exe:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>sudo apt install wine-binfmt
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Make a temporary directory for Wine to keep its fake-Windows files in
   (I usually put it in Cargo&rsquo;s <code>target/</code> directory,
   so it will get cleaned up along with everything else):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mkdir target/wineprefix
export WINEPREFIX=$PWD/target/wineprefix
</pre></div>


</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I can run the executable I built earlier:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ cargo run --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
    Finished dev <span class="o">[</span>unoptimized + debuginfo<span class="o">]</span> target<span class="o">(</span>s<span class="o">)</span> in <span class="m">0</span>.0 secs
     Running <span class="sb">`</span>target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/windows-demo.exe<span class="sb">`</span>
Hello, world!
</pre></div>


<p>You can run tests the same way:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ cargo <span class="nb">test</span> --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
    Finished dev <span class="o">[</span>unoptimized + debuginfo<span class="o">]</span> target<span class="o">(</span>s<span class="o">)</span> in <span class="m">0</span>.0 secs
     Running target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/deps/windows_demo-3e68a12a37931af9.exe

running <span class="m">0</span> tests

<span class="nb">test</span> result: ok. <span class="m">0</span> passed<span class="p">;</span> <span class="m">0</span> failed<span class="p">;</span> <span class="m">0</span> ignored<span class="p">;</span> <span class="m">0</span> measured<span class="p">;</span> <span class="m">0</span> filtered out
</pre></div>


<p>The first time you run a command like this,
Wine may complain bitterly as it sets up the <code>$WINEPREFIX</code> directory,
but after that it should be happy enough.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-32-bit-binaries">What about 32-bit binaries?<a class="headerlink" href="rust-windows-and-debian.html#what-about-32-bit-binaries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>So far,
I&rsquo;ve always told Rust to use the target <code>x86_64-pc-windows-gnu</code>,
which means 64-bit Windows.
However,
there&rsquo;s still a lot of 32-bit Windows installations
out there in the world,
so maybe you&rsquo;d like to produce 32-bit binaries.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;32-bit Windows&rdquo; target
is <code>i686-pc-windows-gnu</code>,
but unfortunately it can&rsquo;t easily be used from Linux.
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32859">Issue 32859</a> has all the details
but as I understand it,
MinGW can be configured in different ways.
While there&rsquo;s a single, obviously correct configuration
for 64-bit Windows,
there&rsquo;s two possible configurations with different trade-offs
for 32-bit Windows,
and Debian and Rust have different opinions about
which one is &ldquo;best&rdquo;.
My current recommendation is to ignore 32-bit Windows,
or use a service like <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/">AppVeyor</a>
that provides a Real Windows installation to build on.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-the-msvc-toolchain">What about the MSVC toolchain?<a class="headerlink" href="rust-windows-and-debian.html#what-about-the-msvc-toolchain" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>This entire document has talked about MinGW,
the Windows port of gcc,
but among actual Windows developers
Microsoft&rsquo;s own Visual C++ compiler is more popular,
and of course it follows Windows&rsquo; platform conventions
much more closely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,
using MSVC from Linux is vastly more complicated
than just <code>apt install</code>ing the right cross-compiler,
and requires
(among other things)
installing Visual Studio on a Windows machine
so you can copy the required files and directories
across to Linux.</p>
<p>Personally,
since I&rsquo;ll eventually need a Windows VM anyway for testing,
and I&rsquo;d need a Windows VM to install MSVC,
I&rsquo;d rather compile my Rust program in the same VM.
If you really want to try it yourself, though,
there are <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/cross-compilation/to-windows.html">official instructions</a>.</p>    </body>
