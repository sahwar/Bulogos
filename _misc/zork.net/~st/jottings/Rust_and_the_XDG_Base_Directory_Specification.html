<p>Rust is a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">fancy new programming language</a> with many good reasons
to recommend it, but one of the things I like most is the tooling built
around it: <a href="http://doc.crates.io/index.html">Cargo</a> is one of the best language-specific package
managers available for any language, while <a href="https://www.rustup.rs/">rustup</a> is a friendly
installer that will give you the latest versions of the compiler, Cargo,
etc. while making it easy to keep them up-to-date.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while these tools are designed to be easy to use, they&rsquo;re
also designed to be cross-platform, which makes life easy and pleasant
for people who work exclusively on Rust across many platforms, but less so
for people who work with many tools on one platform: it&rsquo;s another set of
configuration files and cache directories to clean up, another entry on
<code>$PATH</code>, and so forth.</p>
<p>While there is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1615">a Rust RFC</a> suggesting that Cargo (and hence,
rustup) follow platform-specific conventions out of the box, apparently
there&rsquo;s some technical issues that make it difficult in practice. Also,
it&rsquo;s not immediately obvious what the platform conventions of POSIX
are: the POSIX standard has never mandated any specific conventions for
storing per-user information, and Cargo and rustup don&rsquo;t do anything
wildly uncommon.</p>
<p>While I appreciate that a universal convention might be difficult to
identify and implement, most of the sofware I personally use on a daily
basis follows very well-defined conventions. Specifically, the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base
Directory Specification</a> which says that per-user configuration
should go in <code>~/.config/appname</code> and caches of re-generatable or
re-downloadable data should go into <code>~/.cache/appname</code>. The base directory
spec has a fairly straight-forward extension in <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/file-hierarchy.html">file-hierarchy</a>,
which adds <code>~/.local/bin</code> for per-user binaries that should be available
from the shell. Since I&rsquo;ve already learned those conventions and adapted
them into my workflow, I want to make Cargo and rustup follow them
without having to modify the software myself, and convince upstream to
adopt my changes.</p>
<h2 id="actual-procedure-starts-here">Actual procedure starts here<a class="headerlink" href="Rust_and_the_XDG_Base_Directory_Specification.html#actual-procedure-starts-here" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you already have Cargo or rustup installed, maybe you can migrate
your old configuration but to keep things simple let&rsquo;s just move them
out of the way:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mkdir ~/old-rust-bits
mv ~/.cargo ~/.rustup ~/.multirust ~/old-rust-bits
</pre></div>


<p>Create the directories where we want Cargo and rustup to <em>actually</em> store their stuff:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mkdir -p .local/bin
mkdir -p .cache/cargo
mkdir -p .cache/rustup/downloads
mkdir -p .cache/rustup/tmp
mkdir -p .cache/rustup/toolchains
mkdir -p .cache/rustup/update-hashes
mkdir -p .config/rustup
</pre></div>


<p>Create the old directories that Cargo and rustup look in, and fill them with symlinks to the corresponding XDG-compliant locations:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mkdir -p .cargo
mkdir -p .rustup
ln -sfn .rustup .multirust
ln -sfn ../.local/bin .cargo/bin
ln -sfn ../.cache/cargo .cargo/registry
ln -sfn ../.cache/rustup/downloads .rustup/downloads
ln -sfn ../.cache/rustup/tmp .rustup/tmp
ln -sfn ../.cache/rustup/toolchains .rustup/toolchains
ln -sfn ../.cache/rustup/update-hashes .rustup/update-hashes
ln -sfn ../.config/rustup/settings.toml .rustup/settings.toml
</pre></div>


<p>Now you should be able to install rustup. Note that we pass
<code>--no-modify-path</code> to the installer, because the whole premise of this
operation is that you want rust installed in a location your environment
already knows about, right?</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --no-modify-path
</pre></div>


<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, test that you can run all the shiny new tools:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>rustup --version
cargo --version
rustc --version
</pre></div>


<p>You might even want to install something, to verify Cargo will put things
into the right places:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>cargo install ripgrep
</pre></div>

<p>I created the above list of symlinks by running rustup and cargo in an
isolated environment, looking at what files and directories they created,
and deciding which XDG base-directory they each belonged to. If future
versions of Cargo or rustup change their directory layout, or if the
current versions create other files or directories in circumstances I
haven&rsquo;t exercised, these instructions will need updating.</p>
<p>Properly following the XDG Base Directory Specification requires
you to respect environment variables like <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> and
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</code>, which this example does not do. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
possible to do that without modifying the source-code to these tools,
though.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It has been <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/66g5by/tricking_rust_into_following_the_xdg_base/dgid0ol/">pointed out</a> that if you make rustup
install things into a shared directory like <code>~/.local/bin</code>, you can
never run <code>rustup self uninstall</code>, or it will blow away things it did
not install. Be careful!</p>    </body>
