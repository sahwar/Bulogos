<p><a href="https://higan.byuu.org/">higan</a>, the multi-system emulator,
has changed a whole lot since v106
when the documentation was last updated.
As a starting point for new documentation,
and to help people test higan for themselves,
this tutorial will show you
how to run a SNES ROM in higan v106.217 on Linux.</p>

<h1 id="what-you-need">What you need<a class="headerlink" href="#what-you-need" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>To follow this tutorial exactly, you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A desktop or laptop computer running a modern Linux distro
    (I&rsquo;m using Debian Testing, but Ubuntu/Mint/etc. should be fine)</li>
<li>A copy of the higan <a href="https://cirrus-ci.com/build/6251694783987712">v106.217</a> nightly build
    (Later versions may work,
    but higan is still undergoing significant changes)</li>
<li>A copy of the <a href="https://github.com/VitorVilela7/SnesSpeedTest/raw/master/speed_test_v51.sfc">SNES Speed Test</a> ROM
    (Other ROMs should work,
    but aren&rsquo;t legal to download)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have exactly all these things,
you can still try to follow along with what you have,
and let me know if you run into problems.</p>
<h1 id="installing-things">Installing things<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-things" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>When you download the higan nightly build,
it should be a file named <code>higan-nightly.zip</code>.
Extract it to create a <code>higan-nightly</code> directory,
containing <code>higan</code> and <code>icarus</code> executables,
and <code>Database</code>, <code>Firmware</code>, and <code>System</code> directories.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,
higan does not yet support a &ldquo;portable&rdquo; mode
where it reads required data from beside the executable,
so we&rsquo;re going to have to install all the bits and pieces manually.</p>
<p>From the directory where you extracted <code>higan-nightly.zip</code>,
run the following commands:</p>
<aside>
If <code>~/.local/bin</code> isn't on your <code>$PATH</code>,
see <a href="How_to_set_your_PATH.html">How to set your PATH</a>

<h1 id="setting-up-a-system">Setting up a system<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-system" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Now that everything&rsquo;s installed,
you should be able to launch higan
and see the main window.
It consists of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A menu-bar, containing System, Settings, and Help menus.</li>
<li>The video output,
    a big black area where the running game will eventually appear</li>
<li>The status bar,
    a dark grey bar which displays information about the running game</li>
<li>The system/component pane,
    a white box that lists available systems,
    or the components of the current system</li>
<li>The details pane,
    a light-grey box with a dark-grey higan logo,
    which will contain details of whatever is selected in the component pane</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to play a SNES game,
so we&rsquo;ll need a SNES system.
From the &ldquo;System&rdquo; menu,
choose &ldquo;Create&rdquo;,
and a list of known system will appear in the details pane.</p>
<aside>
All the configuration and details
of each system you create
will be stored in a subdirectory
of <code>~/higan/</code>
</aside>

<p>Because of higan&rsquo;s country-of-origin naming policy,
the SNES is listed as &ldquo;Super Famicom&rdquo;,
so scroll down and select that item in the list.
When an system is selected in the list,
a &ldquo;Name&rdquo; field appears below,
so we can actually name this system &ldquo;SNES&rdquo; like we wanted.</p>
<p>When you have the name the way you want it,
click the &ldquo;Create&rdquo; button in the bottom right,
and a new &ldquo;SNES&rdquo; system will appear in the system pane.
Select it,
and the details pane will show details of the selected system.
Because we haven&rsquo;t configured anything about the system yet,
there&rsquo;s no details other than &ldquo;Super Famicom&rdquo;.</p>
<aside>
You can get back to choose-a-system mode
by opening the "SNES" menu
and selecting "Unload"
</aside>

<p>Double-click the &ldquo;SNES&rdquo; item in the system pane,
and higan will switch to system mode,
listing all the components of this system
in the component pane.
In system mode,
the &ldquo;System&rdquo; menu has been replaced by a &ldquo;SNES&rdquo; menu
(since that&rsquo;s what we named the system),
and there&rsquo;s a new Tools menu.</p>
<h1 id="setting-up-a-controller">Setting up a controller<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-controller" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In the component pane,
select &ldquo;Controller Port 1&rdquo;.
A list of possible controllers
appears in the Details pane.</p>
<aside>
You can imagine having a gamepad configuration
for "XBox controller bindings"
and one for "Playstation controller bindings".
</aside>

<p>We want to create a new controller configuration,
based on the &ldquo;Gamepad&rdquo; template,
so select the entry with the &ldquo;plus&rdquo; icon that&rsquo;s named &ldquo;Gamepad&rdquo;,
and click &ldquo;Create&rdquo; at the bottom.
higan prompts for the name of this new configuration,
but &ldquo;Gamepad&rdquo; is fine for now.</p>
<p>Once the new configuration is created,
it is automatically connected to Controller Port 1,
and it appears beneath it in the component list.
Select the new &ldquo;Gamepad&rdquo; component,
and all the mappable buttons are shown
in the details pane.</p>
<h1 id="connecting-a-cartridge">Connecting a cartridge<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-a-cartridge" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In the component pane,
select &ldquo;Cartridge Port&rdquo;.
A list of available cartridges appears
in the details pane (probably empty).
Like previous versions of higan,
game ROMs must be imported to higan&rsquo;s native format
before they can be played.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the detail pane,
click &ldquo;Import &hellip;&rdquo; to open a file-picker dialog,
and choose the SNES ROM you want to import.
It&rsquo;s not added to the list immediately,
but if you select a different component
then switch back to &ldquo;Cartridge Port&rdquo;,
the ROM you imported should appear in the list.</p>
<aside>
The SNES Speed Test cart has no further configuration,
but for example
the Super Game Boy would have another cartridge port
for a Game Boy game.
</aside>

<p>Select it,
then click &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; in the bottom right.
Like the gamepad did,
the selected cartridge should appear in the component list.</p>
<h1 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game<a class="headerlink" href="#playing-the-game" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Now that we have a system
with a cartridge and a controller connected,
we can turn it on
and see what happens.
From the &ldquo;SNES&rdquo; menu,
choose &ldquo;Power&rdquo;.
For the SNES Speed Test,
you can switch pages of results
with the left and right buttons
on the emulated gamepad.</p>    </body>
