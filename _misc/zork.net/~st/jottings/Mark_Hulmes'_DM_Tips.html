<p>When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3qtZRMtWNaD2Q96STxgOrA">the High Rollers crew</a> started streaming their Dungeons &amp;
Dragons campaign, dungeon master Mark Hulmes got a bunch of questions from
aspiring DMs at the end of each episode, and especially during the Q&amp;A
streams held on weeks without a regular game. As an aspiring DM myself,
I started collecting and collating these tips for my own reference,
and figured I&rsquo;d post them online in case they helped anyone else.</p>
<p>This document should cover the tips presented up to and including
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhzQl30c77M">Episode 65</a> (19th November 2017), as well as the &ldquo;D&amp;D Q&amp;A&rdquo; video
and the &ldquo;Dear Dungeon Master&rdquo; series on Mark Hulmes&rsquo; YouTube channel,

<h2 id="designing-a-campaign">Designing a campaign<a class="headerlink" href="Mark_Hulmes'_DM_Tips.html#designing-a-campaign" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Number one rule: <em>show, don&rsquo;t tell</em>.</p>
<p>Know your group. There&rsquo;s no point in trying to run a deep, political,
deep-backstory-world campaign if all your players want to do is kill
goblins and take their stuff. If that&rsquo;s the type of group that wants to
play, make ia campaign that&rsquo;s going to be fun for them and you: make it
all about killing goblins and taking their stuff, maybe have a bunch of
crazy different goblin tribes with rivalries. Take those ideas, look at
what&rsquo;s fun for your players, and build on that. Over time, they may come
around and enjoy the RP a little more, but make sure they&rsquo;re having fun
initially, you don&rsquo;t want to lose them as players.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a first-time DM, consider running a pre-written adventure
module rather than starting completely from scratch. They do a lot of the
hard work for you, and give you a chance to learn the right mindset. In
particular, <em>The Lost Mines of Phandelver</em> from the D&amp;D Starter Set is
a great introduction. On the other hand, pre-written adventure modules
aren&rsquo;t tuned to the preferences of your particular group of friends,
so there&rsquo;s a risk that people might get bored. Perhaps start off with a
short pre-written adventure and see whether your friends are more keen
on combat or roleplaying or exploring or puzzles and in future you can
create custom campaigns with that in mind.</p>
<p>Have a theme for your campaign so it&rsquo;s not just a generic fantasy
world, something to make your world or game unique. If you have some big
historical events, you can think about how they would change the political
landscape, what factions would form or decay, what the struggles would
be, how those would affect ordinary people, industry, commerce, religion.</p>
<p>Fantasy author Brandon Sanderson has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zmunk/playlists">various lectures on
world-building</a> available on Youtube—covering things like how to
create plausible geography.</p>
<p>For your first campaign, don&rsquo;t make it too big, try and focus on a
region, let&rsquo;s say a valley where there&rsquo;s a couple of settlements, maybe
a couple of interesting locations, some forests, some varied terrain so
you can keep it interesting. Don&rsquo;t start with a world or a continent or
a kingdom, keep it small and then grow it outward when the characters
outgrow that space.</p>
<p>For each location, try to have at least five interesting NPCs, who have
a specific function in that location, and a specific secret that they
have. You might have a shopkeeper with an interesting backstory, a villain
with a secret agenda, a representative or a member of an interesting
group or faction. They should have some aspect that the players will be
interested in, and ask questions about. For other NPCs, just have a list
of location-appropriate names you can pick from on the fly.</p>
<p>For most groups and factions in your world, you can get away with
just noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>who is their leader?</li>
<li>what do they do?</li>
<li>why do they do it?</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s enough to give you a general idea of what the faction&rsquo;s about and
help you imagine how they might react to other events in the world. If
the players actually interact directly with the leader or other faction
members, then you can start fleshing out the society in more detail.</p>
<p>Add some side-questy stuff to each new location, to drive players towards
your next plot hook.</p>
<p>A completely wide-open, sandbox campaign can be very fun, but perhaps
not for a game played on stream, because the audience wants a story they
can follow. Especially if your campaign includes newer players, start
it off with a &ldquo;tutorial&rdquo; which is very story-driven and on the rails,
and then when they get out of the cave and they see Skyrim, give them
a few story hints and they can go off and do what they want. Perhaps
don&rsquo;t give them too many adventure hooks at once, maybe three at most,
and preferably tie them together in some way. As they do more stuff,
they can uncover more adventure hooks and hear about more interesting
locations, and the cycle repeats. To help the players keep track of
everything, have an NPC in the first town give the characters a map with
a few landmarks and areas to &ldquo;avoid&rdquo;, and give the players a physical
copy of that same map to pore over.</p>
<p>Sandbox campaigns also often encourage people to do things other than
adventuring, like running a keep or a tavern, starting a mages guild,
and those can be campaigns in and of themselves.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re coming up with a novel setting for your campaign, you can
pilfer parts of other settings for the same game system. For example,
while you <em>can</em> invent a whole new pantheon for a D&amp;D setting, re-using
a pantheon from a well-known setting saves you a lot of time and means
that experienced players will feel at home while newer players can look
things up online.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re running a game of D&amp;D, consider having your campaign wrap up
about level 16; once the characters reach that level, they&rsquo;re basically
demigods and have access to reality-shaping spells like Wish, which make
it really, really hard for you to create any kind of dramatic tension.</p>
<p>If you want to run a campaign in a low-magic setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider limiting your party to (at most) one arcane spell-caster
    (wizards, warlocks, sorcerers); it&rsquo;s hard to sell the idea that magic is
    rare and wonderful when you have a group of adventurers two wizards,
    a sorcerer, a bard and a warlock. Limiting players&rsquo; choice is not
    always the best idea, but if you want to run a low-magic setting,
    your players need to be on-board.</li>
<li>For divine and natural spell-casters (druids, clerics, etc.), you
    don&rsquo;t have to describe their supernatural abilities with glowy visual
    effects. When a cleric casts &ldquo;cure wounds&rdquo;, perhaps they just whisper
    a prayer to their god and the target just feels that the pain isn&rsquo;t as
    bad, that they&rsquo;re more confident, that they can carry on fighting. When
    a druid casts &ldquo;entangle&rdquo;, instead of a vine erupting from the ground
    to grapple the target, perhaps some nearby bushes just seem to move
    on their own.</li>
<li>Magic should be wonderous—the party shouldn&rsquo;t meet a wizard
    every time they walk into a city or town or village, they should be
    incredibly rare. If you have a player playing as one, it should be a
    big deal, and commoners should react if they see a spell cast. Would
    they be afraid? Awed? Both? Do churches see magic as heresy? Would
    they actively try to burn or kill magic users?</li>
<li>Think about why magic is rare in your world. Perhaps magic users only
    live until 30? Perhaps using magic drains their life force? Perhaps
    it drains the life from other people around them? Perhaps it does
    something to the planet?</li>
<li>If magic is rare but possible, and there are a few people around
    capable of hurling fireballs and generally reshaping reality, why aren&rsquo;t
    those people running things? Are they afraid of being overwhelmed by
    the common folk? Are they afraid of the fury of the gods? Maybe in
    some places, they <em>do</em> run things!</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll need to be super-stingy with magic items, even items with minor
    enchantments would be legendary items spoken of around campfires. If
    the party are hauling magic swords out of every tomb, dungeon and
    goblin cave, those items aren&rsquo;t special, but if the party go on a
    huge quest to the tomb of a buried king to find a legendary blade,
    then have to re-power it or re-forge it, then that makes it special.</li>
<li>In a low-magic setting like Lord of the Rings, magic doesn&rsquo;t solve a
    lot of problems. Yes, Gandalf comes to the rescue of Helm&rsquo;s Deep and he
    shows a blinding light, but he&rsquo;s not throwing fireballs and shooting
    lightning bolts or making a castle fly. The real problem-solvers in
    LotR are the common folk like Aragon, Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin,
    Legolas and Gimli. They&rsquo;re killing orcs, they&rsquo;re convincing the king to
    rejoin the alliance, they&rsquo;re searching for their friends and tracking
    them down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, write up a description of your world and hand it out to
your players before they create their characters, and give them the
opportunity to ask questions about it. Maybe some area or faction or
group will intrigue them, and you can build up more detail about that
group so the player can have a more specific back-story. Maybe a player
will want to create a character whose backstory contradicts the general
rules—that&rsquo;s an opportunity to add even more detail to your world,
and creates more story hooks for that character describing how their
unusual situation came to be.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character creation<a class="headerlink" href="Mark_Hulmes'_DM_Tips.html#character-creation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When creating characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>try to do it as a group session</li>
<li>hand out a basic description of your world to everyone, &ldquo;basic things
    about the world that every reasonably-educated character would know&rdquo;</li>
<li>each player answers some questions, like:<ul>
<li>who is an ally to your character and why?</li>
<li>who is a rival to your character and why?</li>
<li>pick another member of the group, how do you know them and why?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>let the players help with world-building too:<ul>
<li>let them invent (or choose) a place their character came from</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s unique about that place?</li>
<li>what&rsquo;s a secret that outsiders wouldn&rsquo;t know?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in the same way, let them invent a dungeon, a faction with some
    particular goal, that kind of thing</li>
<li>bonus: have everybody hand their answers to the player to their left,
    and then <em>that</em> person add secrets about the player&rsquo;s world-building
    that the original player doesn&rsquo;t know.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool for players to have secrets about their own characters,
but maybe not secrets that affect other players like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m secretly the
person from the other player&rsquo;s backstory that killed their parents and
that they&rsquo;ve sworn vengeance against&rdquo;—that can be pretty disruptive
to a party.</p>
<p>If a player wants a character that doesn&rsquo;t really line up with any of
the standard classes, consider whether you can take the mechanics of an
existing class and reskin them: perhaps instead of casting spells from
spell-slots with a wave of the hand, the character draws pictures on
canvasses that come to life. Mechanically it&rsquo;s the same thing and will
have the same balance, but the flavour is different.</p>
<p>If one character wants to be a villain while the rest of the party is
good (or at least trying to be decent), that can be very disruptive
and quickly lead to arguments. If you have a very mature, very clever
player that can do it very well, that can be amazing, but that is the
rarity. Having a player who wants to be revealed as the main villain
can work in a one-shot, but not recommended for a major campaign unless
the evil character is a guest who can run away and become an NPC villain
afterward. Having an evil campaign where everybody in the party is evil
or selfish is fine, but mixing good and evil characters is always tricky.</p>
<p>If you do wind up with an evil character in a good party (or vice versa)
and it&rsquo;s not working out, maybe have a chat with the player in question
and maybe have the character bow out of the campaign, and have the player
roll a new character with a more fitting alignment.</p>
<p>Be very careful about thinking of it as &ldquo;your story&rdquo;. Yes, you&rsquo;re the
narrator, you&rsquo;re the person who&rsquo;s creating the world, you&rsquo;re leading
the NPCs and monsters, and you&rsquo;re controlling lots of stories that are
happening, but it&rsquo;s not <em>your</em> story, it&rsquo;s the group&rsquo;s story, so you
definitely need to incorporate player stories into whatever it is you&rsquo;re
doing. You don&rsquo;t need to completely reshape your campaign to fit your
players&rsquo; stories, but you can find areas where the two of them match up
and then work them in.</p>
<p>For example, if a player says &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this bad guy, he&rsquo;s after me
for X reasons&rdquo;, you don&rsquo;t have to make that guy the Big Bad of the
entire campaign and base it entirely on that one character, but at the
same time don&rsquo;t just ignore it entirely. Instead, take that character
and unbeknownst to the player they&rsquo;re working for one of your planned
villains, or for an organisation that&rsquo;s already in the world. That way,
there&rsquo;s a potential adventure hook for that player to discover and pull
on if they follow up on their own personal story, but you&rsquo;re also giving
a bit more flavour and depth to the world by incorporating that player&rsquo;s
backstory into something you&rsquo;ve already got planned.</p>
<p>Resist the temptation to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; when a player&rsquo;s backstory contradicts
the world you&rsquo;ve built, instead try to work with the player to find
somewhere for their backstory to fit. If there&rsquo;s nowhere that a player&rsquo;s
backstory fits into your campaign world, strongly consider incorporating
that player&rsquo;s backstory into the world somehow, rather than changing
something already planned.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK for you to know things about a character&rsquo;s backstory that
the player doesn&rsquo;t know, but try not to subvert things or ruin their
character. For example, don&rsquo;t have the cleric&rsquo;s deity turn out to be
evil, Instead, try to build on their backstory as they see it: perhaps
alongside the mainstream church of that deity there is <em>also</em> a cult that
believes evil things about them. Are those beliefs accurate? Who knows!</p>
<p>If you only have two players, but they&rsquo;re experienced, consider letting
them have two characters each. If they&rsquo;re not experienced, perhaps
you could play an NPC mentor character that can die or leave early on,
and let them build up a bit of confidence first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a good idea for the DM to also have a character in the party.
Especially if you&rsquo;re a new DM, it&rsquo;s very easy to make those characters
too powerful, or too important, or too special. It&rsquo;s also very easy for
newer players to look to your character for guidance instead of taking
an active role. It&rsquo;s supposed to be the story of the players&rsquo; characters
growing and becoming heroic, not the story of how a powerful character
told them where to go and what to do. Even if you as the DM keep that
character&rsquo;s notes separate from your campaign notes, it&rsquo;s very easy to do
without realising.</p>
<p>If you really must have an NPC accompany the party, make sure they&rsquo;re not
<em>too</em> special. Sure, they can be an exiled prince or a wizard of a long-lost
order, but if they&rsquo;re the child of a long-lost god or the lost princess who
will unite the realms, the story becomes more about them rather than about
the party whose players you&rsquo;re supposed to be running the game for.</p>
<p>When the player writes up their backstory, not everything in it has to
be true. It&rsquo;s a story from their perspective, but other characters may
see things differently. There should always be things that are perhaps
unknown to the player, even about their own past.</p>
<p>If you ask a player to write a backstory and they give you this huge long
thing, that&rsquo;s fine: it just means more plot-hooks you can weave into the
story for them. You won&rsquo;t need to remember all that detail all the time.</p>
<p>To discourage players from becoming murder hoboes, make sure players are
invested in what they&rsquo;re doing and that they&rsquo;re invested in the world
around them. Encourage them to come up with a more detailed backstory than
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a barbarian and I have an axe&rdquo;. Characters should have a history,
and people that they know, and you can drop those things into the story
really early, even at level 1. If one of the players comes up with a
really cool-sounding town, have them start in that town. That player
is immediately invested, and their character meets people they know. If
another member of the party tries to chop up the barmaid, that player&rsquo;s
going to care and their character&rsquo;s going to put a stop to it. If a player
says &ldquo;I&rdquo;m an orphan, I don&rsquo;t know anyone&rdquo;, maybe they have a rival,
and that rival shows up to steal the treasure from a dungeon the party
is exploring, or shows up in town to make a fool of them. Then, that
player is going to say &ldquo;I want to kill <em>that</em> guy&rdquo; and now your murder
hobo is being directed to a plot and storyline, and you can build on it.</p>
<p>Particularly if some people want to play &ldquo;evil&rdquo; characters, it&rsquo;s worth
getting the players to agree on some ground rules at the beginning:
is everybody OK with players stealing from each other? is everybody OK
with players killing each other? These things are generally possible
according to the game rules, but at the end of the day an RPG group is
also a friendship group, and the players have to trust each other and
be comfortable in each other&rsquo;s company.</p>
<h2 id="planning-a-session">Planning a session<a class="headerlink" href="Mark_Hulmes'_DM_Tips.html#planning-a-session" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Before thinking of encounters for a session, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>what are the current story hooks competing for the players&rsquo; attention?</li>
<li>what did the party do in the previous session?</li>
<li>at the end of the previous session, what did the players say they
    were going to do next?<ul>
<li>remember this is not a promise, and they <em>might</em> do anything,
    so prepare at least a little bit for all the story hooks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what are the villains up to?<ul>
<li>how will their immediate and long-term plans change as a
    consequence of the party&rsquo;s actions?</li>
<li>what consequences of the villains&rsquo; actions will be visible or
    known to the party or their allies and quest-givers?</li>
<li>villains may cooperate if their goals align, if only because it
    reduces the number of loose story threads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what are the party&rsquo;s allies up to, and will the consequences of
    their actions be visible or known to the party?</li>
<li>do you have any guest players who want to join for the next session?</li>
</ul>
<p>To come up with encounters for a session, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>which villain activity is going to be closest to where the party
    is headed?<ul>
<li>will villains ambush the party</li>
<li>will victims call for aid?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>which allies and quest-givers are going to be closest to where the
    party is headed?<ul>
<li>will allies call for aid?</li>
<li>if they don&rsquo;t call for aid, is the party likely to drop by and
    say hello anyway?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a clear idea of what&rsquo;s happening around the party, browse
through the Monster Manual to see if there&rsquo;s any monsters that seem
thematically appropriate, or that could be tweaked to suit upcoming
NPCs. If you haven&rsquo;t used these monsters in this campaign before, you
might want to spend some time world-building, deciding where they came
from and why they are cooperating with the villains.</p>
<p>To make monsters more interesting you can add some real-world background or
flavour. For example, in the real world hyenas live in matriarchal
societies, so you might apply the same trait to gnolls. Hobgoblins are
described as having a martial culture, so why not go all out and model
their society after the late Roman empire, or even feudal Japan? Drow
society is split up into &ldquo;houses&rdquo; with ever-shifting allegiances, why not
make them hyper-capitalist corporations?</p>
<p>When actually putting together the list of encounters for a session try
to follow a structure with a beginning, middle and end. The beginning
should be exciting: a fight, something happens, a murder, an assassin,
something jumps out and kicks everything off. The middle should be
the investigation or exploratory phase: give the players something or
somewhere to explore. Maybe it&rsquo;s finding clues to who the murderer is,
maybe it&rsquo;s exploring the ancient temple and solving a puzzle. The ending
should be a climax: a big boss fight, a big reveal, something like that.</p>
<p>Try to have interesting characters. Don&rsquo;t rely on lazy tropes like
&ldquo;prostitute with a heart of gold&rdquo; or &ldquo;somebody killed my parents&rdquo;, those
have been done to death. However, some tropes are fine—the jokey,
jovial Jack Sparrow swashbuckler is fine, and people can have a lot of
fun with it. Just add <em>something</em> to it, add a little thing to that trope
to make it unique. Maybe that swashbuckler is flamboyant and flirtatious,
but maybe he&rsquo;s gay? Maybe he&rsquo;s an orc that&rsquo;s heard these amazing stories
about these sword masters and adventurers who get all these ladies and
he&rsquo;s always been a bit of an outcast so he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a
swashbuckler!&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s got this gruff voice and he&rsquo;s very intimidating
but he tries to be this charming swashbuckler.</p>
<p>If you have an NPC join the party, it should be an ally that joins the
party for some sort of mutual benefit, like a common enemy or a common
goal. Once the story arc is over, that NPC should go off to do their own
things. That way, the players never feel like they&rsquo;re overshadowed, but
they feel like they&rsquo;ve had an ally. Also, try and make them so they don&rsquo;t
know everything: if the party asks them for advice, perhaps they give bad
advice—not necessarily malicious advice, but maybe uninformed or from a
very different point of view (&ldquo;wrong genre savvy&rdquo;). Maybe the NPC even asks
the players for advice! Let the players take the lead, don&rsquo;t ever make your
character the leader giving the player characters orders, that just robs
them of any decision-making and fun.</p>
<p>Try to have interesting locations, too. Don&rsquo;t just have a dungeon,
have a dungeon built by a mad beholder that&rsquo;s sentient and can move
around on its own. If you create a location with an interesting story,
a good reward, and it&rsquo;s tied into the players&rsquo; activities or backstories,
they&rsquo;ll want to go there, always. A really strong theme helps, too: if
you can say &ldquo;the underwater crystalline tower of the merfolk&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s
way more interesting than just &ldquo;the crystalline tower&rdquo;. You can make
a location even more interesting by twisting the theme: for example,
when the players visit &ldquo;fire temple of ifrit&rdquo; they bring all their
fire-resistance potions but it turns out the fires burned out centuries
ago and now the place is filled with rock monsters.</p>
<p>While some groups love exploring huge, sprawling dungeons, they can often
get quite stale and boring, both for the DM and the players. Instead,
keep dungeons smaller and focus on functionality. Is your dungeon a
temple? a ruin? a barracks for some sort of goblin force? a mine? Where
do people sleep? Where do they eat? What rooms would they trap? If
they&rsquo;re going to put traps down, how do the people who are supposed to go
through avoid them? If nobody lives there (say, it&rsquo;s a ruin or a cave),
did the current inhabitants (bandits, monsters, etc.) set the traps,
or were they left by previous inhabitants? Are the current monsters
immune to the traps? If so, why? What&rsquo;s powering these traps, and why
has the power-source lasted so long? If you&rsquo;re desiging the temple of
an evil cult, where do they hold their meetings? Would the cult leader
have some method for maintaining power while holding a meeting? Would
they have a lever that dumps a chair into a lava pit?</p>
<p>If you want a town map you can hand to your players, look up maps of old,
medieval towns online and trace over them, making whatever modifications
you need to fit the locations you&rsquo;ve planned.</p>
<p>If you want a vibrant, living city:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the history of real-world cities and the upheavals and
    changes that shaped them.</li>
<li>How did it grow to the size that it is? Why is it so popular and
    wealthy? Is it the location, is it governed particularly well, is it
    the capital of a large and prosperous kingdom?</li>
<li>Who lives there and why? What are the local amenities and natural
    resources?</li>
<li>Like every other location, theme is important. Nobody will remember
    Generic Fantasy City 101 where there&rsquo;s a king and a castle and maybe
    a wizard that lives in the palace, merchants, etc. But people might
    remember a city ruled by a Merchants&rsquo; Council and has strict trade
    laws or taxes. Pepople might remember a city that has an elven slum
    or a dwarf district that only dwarves can live in.</li>
<li>Cultural segregation is a sad part of our history, but it can help
    make a city&rsquo;s past more fascinating, or lead to conflict that shapes
    its history. Why do dwarves only live in that district? Are they
    allowed out, or have they walled themselves in? Why are elves living
    in a slum? Is the city ruled by racists? Is there a criminal element
    destabilising the area?</li>
</ul>
<p>The best story hooks always come from people. If you make interesting
characters, or you give characters interesting motivations and goals,
hooks will naturally arise. Maybe you have a wealthy merchant who
wants to create a devil-worshipping cult—how would they go about
that? What actions are they going to take to recruit people to join? What
consequences of those actions might become visible to the party? Does
he have some artifact he&rsquo;s using to convert people? Where does he store
it? What&rsquo;s guarding it?</p>
<p>For building encounters, follow the instructions in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s
Guide to pick a mix of monsters at the desired challenge level for your
PCs. Maybe stick to easy/medium encounters unless your players really
love combat and the party includes a tank/healer/DPS/etc. Remember that the
environment can greatly affect how difficult a combat encounter is: a fight
inside an active volcano with lava everywhere is going to be more difficult
than fighting the same monsters in a grassy, open field.</p>
<p>For minor villains, you can just use the stat blocks from the Monster
Manual, perhaps with minor tweaks like some extra spells just to give
them a bit of a theme and flavour, or tweaks to their stats to represent
who they are or what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>For major (humanoid) villains, you don&rsquo;t have to prepare a full character
sheet, you can write up their stats like a monster stat block, but you
can give them class abilities, class levels, etc. Rather than rolling
their stats, just give them stats that represent their capabilities in
the story. Note that humanoid villains will probably need henchmen and
minions to be balanced against your party; a level-9 sorcerer villain
will be destroyed by a level-9 party of adventurers.</p>
<p>For monsterous villains, take the monster stat block, add class levels
and then adjust the stats as appropriate. Monsterous villains can probably
take on your party single-handedly, but you can add things like legendary
actions and lair actions to balance the encounter appropriately.</p>
<p>Balancing a puzzle encounter is basically impossible; try to set up
the puzzle so that if the players solve it, they get a cool reward and
bypass a threat, and if they can&rsquo;t then they have to face a difficult
but straight-forward encounter, like a tough combat encounter. That way,
the characters are encouraged to attempt the puzzle, but they&rsquo;re not
road-blocked if they can&rsquo;t solve it.</p>
<p>Accept that players won&rsquo;t always find all the clues and plot-hooks
you&rsquo;ve left out for them. As a DM, you know everything, and it&rsquo;s very
easy to forget that what&rsquo;s obvious to you isn&rsquo;t always obvious to your
players, so you&rsquo;ve really got to prepare yourself for them to miss clues
now and then—they didn&rsquo;t pick up the bad guy&rsquo;s journal with all the
explanations, or missed the clues to who really did all the murders. Make
sure you have some backup plans and redundancies so they can find another
route back onto the path that you laid out.</p>
<p>For plotting road-trip style campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>maybe don&rsquo;t go super-hard-core about tracking how far the characters
    can travel in a day and how many rations they require, instead just
    plan some interesting locations for them to come across as they travel
    and montage past the actual travelling.</li>
<li>alternatively, do the opposite and make them track how much food
    and water they can carry, how much it weighs, and do the whole Oregon
    Trail thing. Maybe if they&rsquo;re in open terrain and they don&rsquo;t have
    tents, roll for weather and if it&rsquo;s raining, the next day they have
    exhaustion and can&rsquo;t travel as far. Or, if they camp in the woods,
    do they post a guard? Maybe an animal attacks them in the night,
    or ghosts, or whatever. Maybe they just get random encounters every
    X miles along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your campaign is getting stale and players aren&rsquo;t having as much fun,
remember the original theme, what made it interesting, and try to go back
to that. If all else fails, you can have an NPC suddenly kick open the
door and kick off something new. start a fight, announce a world-changing
event, whatever.</p>
<p>If you have an friendly NPC you want the players to be genuinely scared
to fight:</p>
<ul>
<li>have them encounter the NPC fighting a super-scary creature (maybe a
    levelled-up version of something they&rsquo;ve already fought) and defeating
    it. Not in one blow, so the players can see his impressive defense as
    well as attack.</li>
<li>If the party is in a difficult fight, have the NPC wander past and
    easily defeat the enemies that were giving the party trouble.</li>
<li>Have people go quiet when he enters a room, have other NPCs
    immediately defer to him, that kind of thing.</li>
<li>If they attack anyway, maybe the NPC can throw the party in prison to
    let them cool down and visit them later to negotiate a more diplomatic
    solution.</li>
<li>Or just let the players attack and have their asses handed to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a villainous NPC you don&rsquo;t want players to kill just yet,
rememember that smart enemies have an escape plan; a scroll of teleport
or a ring of invisibility or a potion of gaseous form or something. It&rsquo;ll
make your players mad, but in a good way—they&rsquo;ll want to track the bad
guy down, boom, story! Alternatively, if the NPC is much more powerful
than the players, have them demonstrate their badass-ness by deflecting
attacks with cool retorts or whatever.</p>
<p>You can have an NPC give the players mutually-exclusive quests, so the
players have to decide which leads to follow and which leads will be
left behind.</p>
<p>When it comes to balancing an adventure, generally you want to have
something along the lines of two easy, two medium, one hard and
potentially one deadly encounter. A deadly encounter is probably best
for a big boss battle, something that really challenges the party, so
probably stick to hard encounters at most. Keep in mind your players&rsquo;
abilities, if there&rsquo;s no tank in the party you might want to dial things
down a bit, if they have no magical weapons then a creature that&rsquo;s immune
to non-magical damage is probably a bad idea, etc.</p>
<p>Other ways to include a scary monster while reducing the risk of a total
party kill:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the party some NPC allies</li>
<li>Give the party some NPC enemies so the monster&rsquo;s attention is divided</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t have the party fight the monster directly, have them break
    &ldquo;the soul prisms that keep the monster from breaking into the material
    plane&rdquo; or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got some players who love min-maxing and some newbies, maybe ask
the min-maxers to ease off a bit so they don&rsquo;t cruise through combat and
make things boring for everyone. On the other hand, min-max&rsquo;d characters
are probably strong in one area because they&rsquo;re weak in others, so think
about encounters that emphasise those weak areas to give the newbies a
chance to shine.</p>
<p>Advice for over-preparing: have a list of names, a list of bad guys,
a list of cool locations and some information about them (2-3 bullet
points). If the players decide to explore something you hadn&rsquo;t prepared,
pick a location, pick a villain to live there and name them from the list.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t agonise too much over NPCs and story hooks, and don&rsquo;t plan too much
in advance. At the end of the day, your players can choose to go left
instead of right, they can befriend the bad guy rather than fight them,
they can kill an ally instead of helping them. It&rsquo;s their game as much
as it is yours, and that&rsquo;s OK, it&rsquo;s OK to let them have that control. If
they don&rsquo;t do something that you planned, that&rsquo;s OK, you can put it on
the back burner and save it for another time, reskin it, reuse it somehow.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been giving your party minor magic items like health potions or
+1 weapons or armour with minor enchantments and you&rsquo;re worried you&rsquo;ve
given out too many, that&rsquo;s not a big deal, just keep it in mind and
maybe don&rsquo;t give them any new magic items for a while. It&rsquo;s not going
to overbalance them too badly, try and factor it into your encounters,
remember that creatures that can only be harmed by magical weapons will
become less dangerous, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve given your party too many strong magic items, or too-powerful
items, there&rsquo;s two ways you can scale it back:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can have those magic items begin to fail or fade, as long as
    if the party investigates, there&rsquo;s a reason why. That might be that
    they&rsquo;re old items, they need recharging, they need a special type of
    gemstone or magical energy that they need to obtain from somewhere. Once
    they&rsquo;ve gone on a quest to get that power-source, to get them recharged,
    to dip them into the magic fountain at the ancient elven temple to
    the god of magic&hellip; that&rsquo;s a quest, and once they do it and they renew
    their item, they&rsquo;ve got a reward and you don&rsquo;t need to give them a new,
    more powerful item.</li>
<li>this is a lot less fun, but players get robbed sometimes. If a
    bunch of well-respected, good thieves in a big city learn that there&rsquo;s
    scrub fighter wandering around proundly showing off his magical sword
    that cuts through stone, they&rsquo;re going to want to steal it. That also
    generates a story, it gives them an enemy or a rival, the players will
    want to steal it back or take it back by force, but it can feel a bit
    like a &ldquo;screw you&rdquo; to your players.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s a line between letting players bear the consequences of their
actions, and luring them to their dooms. If the party sneaks into the
dragon&rsquo;s lair and the dragon kills them all, that&rsquo;s OK, but only if the
threat was properly sign-posted beforehand.</p>
<h2 id="running-a-session">Running a session<a class="headerlink" href="Mark_Hulmes'_DM_Tips.html#running-a-session" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In general, when players want to do something, try to say &ldquo;yes, and&hellip;&rdquo; or
&ldquo;yes, but&hellip;&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to say no, but if
you can, ask them for some kind of check to see if they succeed. If
they fail, don&rsquo;t punish them too hard, come up with something funny,
something that everyone around the table can enjoy, don&rsquo;t make them
fall to their death or wind up unconscious in melee range of an ogre,
because that&rsquo;s not fun for the player.</p>
<p>For truly new players, consider printing them a card or sheet that lists
the most common mechanics, like &ldquo;in a round of combat, you can move
and do an action, which can be an attack, a spell, a disengage, a dash,
&hellip;&rdquo; Encourage them to use their skills in creative ways, &ldquo;if you can
imagine it, you can try it&rdquo;, that kind of thing. You will need to lead
them by the hand a little bit, give them a couple of clear objectives,
but also give them room to explore and be creative. Remind them that
it&rsquo;s OK to take inspiration from books and movies and games, but don&rsquo;t
let them do carbon copies, encourage them to come up with (at least)
one thing that makes their character special and unique.</p>
<p>If your group only gets together a couple of times a month and your time
is limited, it&rsquo;s easy for &ldquo;game time&rdquo; to devolve into &ldquo;just hang out
and talk about whatever&rdquo; time. That&rsquo;s good! Don&rsquo;t let the game get in
the way of your friends enjoying each other&rsquo;s company! However, if you
want to play the game too, maybe get everybody together an hour early so
they have time to catch up, have a chat, have a laugh, and then start
the game afterward. Then, have another break for half an hour or so,
halfway through. Or, if your group have difficulty getting back into the
game after the break, make the session shorter and have a full hour of
chatting afterward.</p>
<p>When describing an environment, you can give players a hint that some
feature might be investigatable without explicitly calling it out as
&ldquo;strange&rdquo; or saying &ldquo;you should look at this&rdquo; by highlighting it verbally,
mentioning something unusual about it or just mentioning it
specifically. If a player is interested, they&rsquo;ll lean in and start
asking questions, and that&rsquo;s when you can say &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you give me an
investigation check?&rdquo;. Whatever aspect you describe <em>might</em> have a
perfectly ordinary cause (and sometimes it should, just to keep the players
on their toes).</p>
<p>When it comes to players handling traps (in D&amp;D), the &ldquo;Perception&rdquo; skill
(including passive perception) is good for noticing things that are out of
place, but the &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; skill is what you need to actually find the
mechanisms. Then disabling the trap becomes a more creative, problem-solving
thing rather than just a dice-check.</p>
<p>If your group gets distracted and chatty during combat, give them each
reference sheets for the combat rules (what actions are allowed, in what
combinations, with creative examples) so they can consider what they want
to do during other players&rsquo; turns. To speed up combat, don&rsquo;t throw high-HP
enemies at them, don&rsquo;t throw millions of enemies at them, try to ensure
everybody has something to fight (but for variety, sometimes have an enemy
that&rsquo;s tough enough for two players, etc.). If you reduce monster HP but
increase their damage output, that will make fights much more dynamic,
faster, flow better, but also riskier. Also, make sure that every fight,
there&rsquo;s interesting stuff that they can be thinking about and planning
around: environmental hazards, exploding barrels, jump pads, things that
change the arena layout, different heights, anything to promote creative
and tactical thinking. Explain to the players that when it&rsquo;s not their
turn, they should think about what they want to do next.</p>
<p>If your group gets distracted and chatty in social encounters, make sure
you&rsquo;re engaging all of the players. Even if an NPC is having a one-on-one
conversation with somebody, that NPC can turn to the other characters
and say &ldquo;And what do you all think of this?&rdquo;. In a conversation that can
only be one-on-one, pause it every paragraph or so and turn to the other
players: &ldquo;while that conversation is happening, what are you guys doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what rules apply to a given situation, don&rsquo;t make
everybody wait around while you look it up, just make up something on
the spot. You can look up the real answer later, and at the beginning
of the next session tell your players that you got a thing wrong and
here&rsquo;s how that thing is going to work in the future.</p>
<p>If players come up with a really creative and cool way to take down your
villain, don&rsquo;t rob them of that victory. Any NPC important enough that
the players want to kill them is probably important enough that their
death will have consequences in the world, and not of the &ldquo;make the
whole problem go away&rdquo; variety. Maybe the NPC&rsquo;s lieutenant will want
revenge on the party, maybe even worse individuals will seek to fill
the power vacuum.</p>
<p>You cannot possibly plan for every thing your players will do. Think
through what you think the players will do for the next session, but for
the rest of the world just have locations you know are nearby, with a few
bullet-points each. if the players go there, you&rsquo;ll just have to wing it,
but you may be able to re-use encounters you already had planned. Pirates
become cave-dwelling orcs, the encounter in the tavern is transplanted
to the orcs&rsquo; central camp, etc. etc.</p>
<p>If some of the party want to gang up on another player&rsquo;s character,
consider what the consequences might be: there might be other people
in the world who want to protect that character from harm (allies,
enemies that have longer-term plans, etc.) so maybe you can just let
the situation play out. However, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that stuff like
that can really upset people, and at the end of the day an RPG group is
also a friendship group. You&rsquo;ve got to be good friends, you can&rsquo;t just be
&ldquo;well, the game allows me to screw you over, so I will&rdquo; because that will
ultimately lead to problems. Talk it over with the players in question
(individually) to figure out whether it&rsquo;s coming across as malicious,
whether it <em>is</em> malicious, whether the other players don&rsquo;t like the target
player or they don&rsquo;t like the character. If everybody&rsquo;s fine with it
and it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it would damage real-world friendships, then by
all means let it happen, but you should be neutral when adjudicating it.</p>
<p>If your players are being murder hobos, there&rsquo;s a number of common causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>some players think of tabletop RPGs as being like videogames where
    there&rsquo;s few or no consequences for your actions</li>
<li>some players are legitimately murder-hoboing to have fun</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, you can show these players (the hard way) that this is
not a videogame, and that their actions have consequences—they can be
arrested, locked up, maimed, have spells cast on them that prevent them
from doing certain things&hellip; people are going to come after them, and
they&rsquo;re going to be the bad guys. Super-powered paladins will be coming
to arrest them, the king might put a bounty on their head so random
criminals will come after them. That can descend into a fun campaign as
well, but it&rsquo;s about learning that they can&rsquo;t just do whatever they want
and get away with it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t overdo it, though; if players are having fun being murder hoboes,
you don&rsquo;t want to spoil their fun, because you want them to enjoy
it as a group activity and have a good time, but give them realistic
consequences. Don&rsquo;t punish them, don&rsquo;t have a squad of level 10 characters
turn up to arrest them and make it miserable and not fun, have a party
of equal level and size show up&hellip; and if the player party gets away,
there&rsquo;ll be another, bigger party with twenty militia men, and that&rsquo;ll
be a problem even for level five characters.</p>
<p>If your players have access to reality-shaping spells like Wish in
D&amp;D, this can make it difficult to maintain any kind of narrative
structure. Consider learning from every genie in every story ever and
require players to state their wish as specifically as possible, and
interpret it as ironically as you can. It can feel a bit like you&rsquo;re
screwing the players over and that&rsquo;s a bit unfair, but you&rsquo;ve got to
think about it in the context of &ldquo;how mental is this?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re consistently rolling critical hits and maximum damage against
your party (or the opposite), check your dice for air pockets. Air
pockets do sometimes happen during the manufacturing process, and they
can change a die&rsquo;s weight distribution to make it role some numbers much
more frequently than intended.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re heading toward a party-wipe because you&rsquo;re rolling unnaturally
well (as opposed to because the party deliberately aggravated a powerful
creature, or because they have terrible tactics) and the players obviously
aren&rsquo;t having fun, rather than fudging your rolls perhaps have the villain
stop attacking them, or say &ldquo;ha ha ha, see you&rsquo;re no match for me&rdquo; and
lock them up so they have a chance to escape, or &ldquo;flee while you can,
mortals, next time I won&rsquo;t be so lenient&rdquo; and let them run away.</p>
<p>If a player rolls a bunch of natural 1s in a row, to the point where
they&rsquo;re not having fun, rather than let them fudge the roll out of pity,
describe the effect in a way that gives them a small boon or an advantage
on their next roll so they can at least feel like they&rsquo;ve done something.</p>
<p>For ordinary enemies and minor villains, don&rsquo;t bother with death saving
throws unless the party makes an effort to heal them—assuming it hasn&rsquo;t
been too many rounds since they went down.</p>
<p>For major villains, if the players walk away from the body, or a minion
drags or teleports the body to safety, or they can otherwise escape,
absolutely roll death saving throws for them. It&rsquo;s fair, since the players
get them, and it also means that sometimes you get something even better
than a great villain: a great villain who&rsquo;s come back from the dead.</p>
<p>At the end of every session, ask your players what they&rsquo;re likely to do
next, so you can prepare more details about those places in advance.</p>
<h2 id="afterward">Afterward<a class="headerlink" href="Mark_Hulmes'_DM_Tips.html#afterward" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>If you need a real-world hiatus from your campaign, try to bring the
story to a point where you can naturally have a time gap. Finish off a
story arc where the characters feel they&rsquo;ve succeeded at something, or
completed a story arc, or something very bad has happened to the point
where the party has scattered to the four winds and reconnect in six
weeks, so when you do come back it feels like a natural progression of
time. You might also offer your players a chance to buy consumables or
upgrade their gear by talking to you directly, rather than having the
player role-play their character going into a shop during a session.</p>    </body>
