<blockquote>
<p>But the other gods disagreed, saying &ldquo;Surely no one number is more beautiful than any other!&rdquo;. So the Creator set out to build a universe based around his beloved Thirty-Two, one that would demonstrate once and for all the supremacy of that particular number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A while ago, I got a mobile phone that could run specially-crafted Java applications. Being a small and rather cheap phone, there were a number of limitations on the programs it would run; for example, it had a very slow processor, a tiny (96x64) display, and would not accept programs larger than 64KB. I wondered what kind of game might suit such a limited platform - it would have to be turn-based, not rely too much on graphics, and would preferably be algorithm-based rather than requiring stored level maps. The obvious solution: a roguelike!</p>
<p>So I set about planning how I might squeeze a roguelike into a form acceptable to this phone. I recalled hearing about how Elite generated multiple galaxies filled with stars and solar-systems based on a very small random seed, I recalled . As I pondered storing items, monsters and levels space-efficiently, I started obsessing a little over the number 32, and, well, here we are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The creator carved out thirty two planes, each thirty-two cubits square, and linked them together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dungeon is a series of 32 levels, each 32x32 squares. I haven&rsquo;t decided on whether levels should be regenerated every time.</p>

<p>A creature, either a monster or the Player is represented by two 32-bit words, called Intrinsics and State. Intrinsics is a bit-field, where each bit represents a particular skill or attribute, while State has a number of things packed into it.</p>

<p>Upon creation, a monster will have a number of its Intrinsics bit set, according to the level upon which it&rsquo;s generated - so a monster on level 5 will have five intrinsic abilities, and every monster on the last level will have everything. The player starts with no intrinsics, but can add them via equipment, enchantment, etc.</p>
<p>Upon creation, a monster will have its Current HP, Current MP, Max HP and Max MP set to the level on which it&rsquo;s generated - so a monster on level 5 will have 5HP, 5MP, etc. The player starts with maybe 3HP/0MP, just so he can&rsquo;t be insta-killed, recovers 1HP every few turns (unless he has Regenerate, in which case every turn), and their max HP/MP is the maximum depth of the dungeon that they&rsquo;ve visited.</p>
<p>I think there should be some kind of MP cost associated with using intrinsics, just so a freakish level-1 monster can&rsquo;t spam you with Mega Blast, although I&rsquo;m not sure how it would work. </p>
<p>Ideally, the intrinsics would be purely random, but you might wind up with a level-4 creature with every kind of damage bonus, but no actual offensive skills. I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s going to be a game-balance problem, though.</p>
