<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR<a class="headerlink" href="#tldr" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Wine 1.7.1 makes pretty much everything Just Work.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Many years ago, <a href="http://www.runicgames.com/">Runic Games</a> came out with an action-roguelike game called
<a href="http://www.gog.com/game/torchlight">Torchlight</a>, which was fairly well-received. I didn&rsquo;t encounter it until
a few years later when it was included in a Humble Indie Bundle, meaning I got
a nice Linux-native, DRM-free version I could mess around with. It turned out
this was a genre of game I greatly enjoyed, and when it turned out that the
sequel was just about to release, I was really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when <a href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/">Torchlight II</a> came out, it was both Windows-only and
DRM-encumbered. Windows-only is not <em>that</em> much of a problem, since Wine&rsquo;s
pretty good these days. DRM was something of a moral issue, but eventually when
Runic made it clear that they were not going to budge I decided I should at
least try it. However, it turned out that the DRM used was also a technical
issue: for whatever reason, it caused Wine to crash at startup. If I obtained
an applied a DRM-crack for the game it&rsquo;d work pretty well, but becoming
dependent on software pirates is probably worse than becoming dependent on DRM.</p>
<p>Anyway, this frustrating state of affairs seems to have been solved by Wine
1.7.1, and in particular <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29448">Wine bug 29448</a>, whose fix landed in that
  version. With that change, Torchlight II works pretty well out of the box.</p>
<p>However, Wine 1.7.1 is still pretty new and a lot of Linux distros probably
don&rsquo;t have it yet (if you&rsquo;re reading this in the Glorious Future where
everybody has Wine 1.7.1 or later in their distro&rsquo;s standard packages, you can
probably safely ignore this entire document) so I thought I&rsquo;d put together
a quick guide for people unfamiliar with PlayOnLinux to get them sorted.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin<a class="headerlink" href="#before-you-begin" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To go through this guide, you&rsquo;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.playonlinux.com/en/">PlayOnLinux</a> installed. It might be available in your distro&rsquo;s
  package-manager, you might have to download it and run it from a tarball,
  whatever. Just have it installed and running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of the Torchlight II installer. Whether it&rsquo;s the stub-installer you
  get from clicking &ldquo;Download the Free Demo&rdquo; on the <a href="http://www.torchlight2game.com/">Torchlight II home
  page</a>, or the full &ldquo;offline installer&rdquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t much
  matter. You just need to have it handy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-step<a class="headerlink" href="#step-by-step" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Start PlayOnLinux, however you have it installed. When it&rsquo;s up and running,
assuming you haven&rsquo;t used it before, it&rsquo;ll start up with an empty list.</p>
<figure><img
    src="01-playonlinux.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux main window, no software shortcuts in the list"
></figure>

<p>From PlayOnLinux&rsquo;s Tools menu, pick &ldquo;Manage Wine versions&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>
<figure><img
    src="02-manage-wine-versions.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux main window, with Manage Wine Versions highlighted in the
    Tools menu"
></figure>

<p>A new window should open listing the available versions of Wine that can be
installed. In the list of available versions, pick &ldquo;1.7.1&rdquo; (or higher, if it&rsquo;s
available).</p>
<figure><img
    src="03-available-versions.png"
    alt="Manage Wine Versions window, showing no custom Wine versions installed"
></figure>

<p>Click the &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; button in the middle, and PlayOnLinux will open a new dialog for
downloading Wine and its various dependencies.</p>
<figure><img
    src="04-installing-wine.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux progress dialog, installing Wine 1.7.1"
></figure>

<p>When it&rsquo;s done, &ldquo;1.7.1&rdquo; should be listed under &ldquo;Installed Wine versions&rdquo; on the
right.</p>
<figure><img
    src="05-installed-versions.png"
    alt="Manage Wine Versions window, showing Wine 1.7.1 installed"
></figure>

<p>Close the Wine version manager window, returning to the main PlayOnLinux
window. This time, on the right of the window, click &ldquo;Install a program&rdquo;. A new
&ldquo;install menu&rdquo; dialog will open.</p>
<figure><img
    src="06-install-menu.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux installation menu, no categories selected"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Install a non-listed program&rdquo; in the bottom-left. A &ldquo;manual
installation&rdquo; wizard will appear.</p>
<figure><img
    src="07-manual-install-01.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, page 1"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, then select &ldquo;Install a program in a new virtual drive.&rdquo;</p>
<figure><img
    src="08-manual-install-02.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, install new or edit existing?"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, then type a name for the new virtual drive - &ldquo;Torchlight2&rdquo; is
a good choice.</p>
<figure><img
    src="09-manual-install-03.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, naming the new drive"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, then tick the box next to &ldquo;Use another version of Wine&rdquo;. Ignore
the others.</p>
<figure><img
    src="10-manual-install-04.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, picking pre-install tweaks"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, then from the list of Wine versions, pick &ldquo;1.7.1&rdquo; that we
installed earlier.</p>
<figure><img
    src="11-manual-install-05.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, picking a custom Wine version"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, then select &ldquo;32 bits windows installation&rdquo;.</p>
<figure><img
    src="12-manual-install-06.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, picking 32-bit Windows"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, wait for the virtual drive to be created, then (when it
eventually appears) click the Browse button, and select the Torchlight
2 installer you downloaded previously.</p>
<figure><img
    src="13-manual-install-07.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, picked the installer"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, and the Torchlight II installation wizard should appear.</p>
<figure><img
    src="14-torchlight2-installer.png"
    alt="Torchlight II's installer, running under Wine"
></figure>

<p>I can&rsquo;t be bothered screenshotting all the pages of the Torchlight II
installation wizard, but here&rsquo;s the options I picked:</p>
<ul>
<li>I agreed to the license agreement</li>
<li>Standard setup</li>
<li>I <strong>unticked</strong> &ldquo;Run Torchlight 2&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, click &ldquo;Finish&rdquo; to exit the Torchlight II installer, and you&rsquo;ll
return to the PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, giving you a list of
installed programs to make shortcuts for. Select &ldquo;tl2.runic.launcher.exe&rdquo; at
the bottom of the list.</p>
<figure><img
    src="15-manual-install-08.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, picked the launcher"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, and change the shortcut name to &ldquo;Torchlight II&rdquo;.</p>
<figure><img
    src="16-manual-install-09.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, naming the shortcut"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, and this time select &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make another shortcut&rdquo;.</p>
<figure><img
    src="17-manual-install-10.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux manual installation wizard, we're done here"
></figure>

<p>Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, and now Torchlight II will be an option in the PlayOnLinux window.</p>
<figure><img
    src="18-installation-complete.png"
    alt="PlayOnLinux main window, listing Torchlight II as an option"
></figure>

<p>Select it, then click &ldquo;Run&rdquo; in the toolbar to launch the Torchlight II
launcher. It should appear and start downloading whatever updates are needed to
take you to the latest version.</p>
<figure><img
    src="19-torchlight2-launcher.png"
    alt="Torchlight 2's launcher, running under Wine"

<p>From here, everything should be exactly the same as it is in the normal Windows
version, including activation.</p>

<p>On my machine (Intel HD4000 graphics, Mesa 9.1 drivers), when the &ldquo;Hardware
skinning&rdquo; option is enabled (which it is by default) the game draws animated
characters (such as the Estherians and a tree on the title-screen) as blank
white shapes, instead of their proper textures. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is
a driver issue or a Wine issue, but disabling &ldquo;Hardware skinning&rdquo; fixes it.</p>
<p>Running GUTS requires .NET 3.5. Running it under Wine gives an error message
about &lsquo;please install Mono for Windows&rsquo;; installing Mono 2.8 (the latest
version in PlayOnLinux) doesn&rsquo;t make it work, and the official .NET installers
don&rsquo;t seem to work properly under Wine either, so no GUTS for you.</p>    </body>
