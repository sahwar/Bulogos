(world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that) N
(work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,) N
(refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a) N
(licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you) N
(copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission) N
(under copyright law.) N
() N
(A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the) N
(Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with) N
(modifications and/or translated into another language.) N
() N
(A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of) N
(the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the) N
(publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall) N
(subject \(or to related matters\) and contains nothing that could fall) N

(them.) N

(The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles) N
(are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice) N

() N
(If you publish printed copies \(or copies in media that commonly have) N

(you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present) N
(the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and) N
(visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.) N
(Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve) N
(the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated) N
(as verbatim copying in other respects.) N
() N
(If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit) N
(legibly, you should put the first ones listed \(as many as fit) N
(reasonably\) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent) N

(more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent) N
(copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy) N
(a computer-network location from which the general network-using) N
(public has access to download using public-standard network protocols) N
(a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.) N
(If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,) N
(when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure) N
(that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated) N
(location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an) N
(Opaque copy \(directly or through your agents or retailers\) of that) N
(edition to the public.) N
() N
(It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the) N

(Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution) N
(and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy) N
(of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:) N

(A. Use in the Title Page \(and on the covers, if any\) a title distinct) N
(   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions) N
(   \(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section) N
(   of the Document\).  You may use the same title as a previous version) N

(   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified) N
(   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the) N
(   Document \(all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five\),) N

(C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the) N
(   Modified Version, as the publisher.) N

(If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or) N
(appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material) N
(copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all) N

(list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.) N
(These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.) N
() N
(You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains) N
(nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various) N
(parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has) N

(includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or) N
(by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,) N

(permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.) N
