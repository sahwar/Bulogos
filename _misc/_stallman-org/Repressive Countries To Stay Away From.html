<p>
  This page lists countries that regularly apply surprising repressive
  laws to visiting foreigners.
</p>
<p>
  We do not try to mention all the repressive regimes that punish people
  for criticizing the regime in a serious way.  There are too many of
  those to mention here, and you're not likely to do that without
  thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
  This page was not made through a systematic study.  Some countries
  not listed may be worse than some countries that are listed.
</p>
<p>
  Why risk a visit to these countries?  Why spend any of your money there?
  Stay away!

	Dubai 
	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/british-academic-matthew-hedges-accused-of-spying-jailed-for-life-in-uae">sentenced
        Matthew Hedges to life in prison</a> after a bad joke of a
        trial.
      </li>

      <li>
	The UAE government has become
	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/22/matthew-hedges-uae-insight-could-have-made-him-target">far more dominant over the
	individual emirates' governments</a>, including that of Dubai.  So
	it is wise to stay away from the whole UAE.
      </li>

      <li>
      <p>
      Matthew Hedges visited Dubai for two weeks and was then arrested
      and charged with spying.  He has been
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/15/matthew-hedges-british-academic-charged-spying-united-arab-emirates">kept
      in solitary for 5 months and is now being tried, effectively
      without a lawyer</a>.</p>
      <p>
      My guess is that some of the questions he asked for academic
      purposes were somehow sensitive to the rulers of Dubai, and they
      reacted in typical Dubai fashion.</p>
      </li>

      <li>

	  He will have to face a bogus trial represented by a lawyer he cannot

	  Matthew Hedges: <em>I was detained in the UAE. I learned that
	  Britain puts trade before its citizens.</em>  He reports
	  being
	  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/26/detained-uae-britain-trade-citizens-foreign-office">tortured

	A foreigner working in Dubai accused a used car seller of
	"ripping
	off" its customers, and
	was <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5305479/brit-jailed-dubai-whatsapp-car-rant/">jailed
	for "insulting"</a>.
      </li>

	  medicine</a> with him.

	  Dubai has accused a tourist of "public indecency" after his

	    another man's hip in a bar</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The court changed his hearing date, didn't tell him, and
	  sentenced him to 30 days in jail for not being clairvoyant.
	  Evidently, Dubai is run by clowns and lunatics.
	</p>

	  A Danish woman accepted a complimentary glass of wine on an

	  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/10/woman-held-in-dubai-with-daughter-for-drinking-glass-of-wine-on-flight">jailed

	  her to leave</a>.

	    A princess from Dubai planned for seven years how to
            escape her life of captivity.  The plan almost succeeded,
            but 
	    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/04/missing-emirati-princess-latifa-al-maktoum-had-planned-escape-for-seven-years">commandos
            grabbed her from a yacht when she had almost reached
            India</a>.  One must suppose that the commandos were sent
            by her father, the emir.
	  </p>
	  <p>
            No one has heard from her since, and she might have been
            killed, or killed herself rather than be captured.  Or she
            may be imprisoned in permenant solitary confinement (see
            Princess, by Jean Sasson, for another instance of this).

	    A visitor from Britain in the UAE went to a football match in which
	    Qatar was playing Iraq.  He put on a shirt that supported Qatar, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/british-man-detained-in-uae-after-wearing-qatar-football-t-shirt-to-match">and

	</p><p>
	  The UAE repression officials claim he is not being
	  prosecuted for wearing a Qatar shirt, but I wouldn't believe
	  a word they say.
	</p><p>
	  I hope he will not be forcibly sent back to the UAE.

	<p>
	  When he was ordered released from prison, thugs grabbed him
	  and put him in a cell again.  Then the authorities took his

	Egyptian officials are frothing at the mouth with fanatical
        prudery.  Since they can't jail the people who made a nude

	  is not safe to drink</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I am sure that statement is true, but it is no shame to Egypt.  How

	  drink from?

Two of three Australian visitors recently imprisoned in Iran have been
freed.  The third <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/05/australian-and-british-bloggers-jolie-king-and-mark-firkin-released-in-iran">has been sentenced to 10 years in prison</a>.</p>

<p>
I give roughly the same advice as the Australian government about
visiting Iran: "reconsider your need to travel", and stay away.</p>

        Junaid Hafeez to death for blasphemy</a>.  The trial was a
        political abuse, since it didn't bother to prove what he
        actually said.  But even if that had been proven, nothing can
        justify punishing people for criticizing a religion.
