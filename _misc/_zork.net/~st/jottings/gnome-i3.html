<p>In the bad old days,
every computer had a monitor,
a keyboard,
a mouse,
and that was it.
These days,
computers have all kinds of extra peripherals,
like screens that can dim,
audio outputs that can change their volume,
and keyboards with buttons to control all those things.
On a modern Linux kernel,
getting those things working can be a hassle,
and if they need to work together
(say, dimming the screen when battery gets low)
it&rsquo;s even more complex.</p>
<p>Luckily,
modern desktop environments handle all this stuff out-of-the-box,
and <a href="https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">GNOME 3</a> is one of the more widely-available
and best-supported options.
Its default configuration is simple
and easy for new users to get started with,
while its modularity and extensibility allow power-users
quite a bit of customisation.</p>
<p>Unluckily,
as flexible and extensible as it is,
GNOME 3&rsquo;s desktop environment is not quite as graceful
at dealing with many windows
as a good tiling window-manager like <a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3</a>.
And the GNOME Shell front-end is fairly tightly linked
with the hardware-management backend.
It would be lovely if there were a GNOME component
that allowed the hardware-management
to run independently of GNOME Shell,
so I could use it with a different window-manager.</p>
<p>It turns out there is.
There&rsquo;s a thing called <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeFlashback">GNOME Flashback</a>,
which makes the modern GNOME 3 infrastructure available
without the GNOME 3 interface,
so that people who preferred the old GNOME 2 interface
can keep using it,
or at least something resembling it.
Because GNOME 2 allowed custom window-managers,
so does GNOME Flashback,
which means we can use it with i3.</p>
<h1 id="instructions">Instructions<a class="headerlink" href="gnome-i3.html#instructions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m using GNOME 3.22 on Debian 9 (&ldquo;stretch&rdquo;).
Your mileage may vary with other versions and other distros.</p>
<h2 id="1-install-dependencies">1. Install dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="gnome-i3.html#1-install-dependencies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to need the GNOME Flashback package,
and of course i3.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt-get install gnome-session-flashback i3
</pre></div>


<h2 id="2-teach-gnome-about-i3">2. Teach GNOME about i3<a class="headerlink" href="gnome-i3.html#2-teach-gnome-about-i3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To create a session with all the required GNOME background services,
the easiest thing is to use <code>gnome-session</code>.
We&rsquo;ll create a session that includes i3 and the GNOME Flashback goodies.</p>
<p>Save this file as <code>~/.config/gnome-session/sessions/gnome-plus-i3.session</code>
(you may need to create the intervening subdirectories yourself):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">[GNOME Session]</span>
<span class="na">Name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">GNOME + i3</span>
<span class="na">RequiredComponents</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">gnome-flashback-init;gnome-flashback;i3;gnome-settings-daemon;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Other GNOME Flashback sessions include additional <code>RequiredComponents</code> like
<code>gnome-panel</code>
(for the traditional GNOME application menu and taskbar)
and <code>nautilus-classic</code>
(to draw desktop icons)
but since those aren&rsquo;t related to hardware support,
I&rsquo;ve left them out.</p>
<p>Also note that <code>RequiredComponents</code> aren&rsquo;t executables,
they&rsquo;re the names of <code>.desktop</code> files in <code>/usr/share/applications</code>
(amongst other places).</p>
<h2 id="3-launch-our-new-session-at-login">3. Launch our new session at login.<a class="headerlink" href="gnome-i3.html#3-launch-our-new-session-at-login" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Adding a new session type to GDM&rsquo;s list of sessions
would require editing system-wide files,
but luckily we don&rsquo;t actually need to do that.
If you have a file named <code>.xsession</code> in your home directory,
GDM will include a session named &ldquo;System X11 Default&rdquo;
that will execute that file as a shell script.</p>
<p>So we just need to write a script that launches <code>gnome-session</code>
and tells it to run our i3-based session instead.
Save the following file as <code>.xsession</code> in your home directory:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Menu tools use this value to decide which applications</span>
<span class="c1"># are approriate for the current session.</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -z <span class="nv">$XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;GNOME-Flashback:GNOME&quot;</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>

<span class="c1"># Run gnome-session and tell it to use our i3 session.</span>
<span class="nb">exec</span> gnome-session --session<span class="o">=</span>gnome-plus-i3 --disable-acceleration-check
</pre></div>


<h2 id="4-teach-i3-about-gnome">4. Teach i3 about GNOME<a class="headerlink" href="gnome-i3.html#4-teach-i3-about-gnome" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>When <code>gnome-session</code> starts a session component,
it typically expects the the component to notify it via DBus
that the the component has started correctly.
i3 knows nothing of DBus,
so <code>gnome-session</code> will launch i3
and wait forever for something to happen.</p>
<p>Instead,
teach i3 to notify <code>gnome-session</code> that it has started
by putting the following lines at the end of <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">exec</span> --no-startup-id dbus-send <span class="se">\</span>
    --session <span class="se">\</span>
    --print-reply<span class="o">=</span>literal <span class="se">\</span>
    --dest<span class="o">=</span>org.gnome.SessionManager <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;/org/gnome/SessionManager&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    org.gnome.SessionManager.RegisterClient <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;string:i3&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;string:</span><span class="nv">$DESKTOP_AUTOSTART_ID</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Also,
to log out of an i3-based session,
you run
(directly, or via a keybinding)
<code>i3-msg exit</code>
to tell i3 to exit.
However,
under gnome-session,
that doesn&rsquo;t actually log you out:
gnome-session might restart i3,
or it might just let it exit,
leaving all your applications still running,
with no way to manually exit them.</p>
<p>Instead,
you should bind your usual logout key to run <code>gnome-session-quit</code>,
which will pop up the traditional GNOME log out dialog,
and which works as you&rsquo;d expect.</p>
<h2 id="4-try-it-out">4. Try it out!<a class="headerlink" href="gnome-i3.html#4-try-it-out" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Log out,
log back in
(and make sure to pick &ldquo;System X11 Default&rdquo; as your session)
and you should be in i3
with all the GNOME services available.</p>

<p>After following the above instructions,
one difference I noticed between GNOME and i3
was that under GNOME,
the terminal bell was a pleasant, subtle sound,
while under i3,
I got the traditional machine beep.</p>
<p>It turns out that something somewhere wasn&rsquo;t telling PulseAudio
to replace the machine beep.
Never mind,
we can tell it ourselves.
Add the following to <code>~/.xsession</code>,
just before the <code>exec gnome-session ...</code> bit.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Redirect the X11 beep to PulseAudio</span>
pactl upload-sample <span class="se">\</span>
    /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/dialog-information.oga <span class="se">\</span>
    x11-bell
pactl load-module <span class="se">\</span>
    module-x11-bell <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nv">display</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$DISPLAY</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    <span class="nv">sample</span><span class="o">=</span>x11-bell
</pre></div>


<p>I happen to like <code>dialog-information.oga</code>
because it matches what I remember from GNOME,
but feel free to try different sounds.</p>

<p>With the release of GNOME 3.34, the above instructions are out of date.</p>
<p>For step 2, &ldquo;Teach GNOME about i3&rdquo;,
<code>gnome-setting-daemon</code> has been deprecated
in favour of a bunch of different DBus services.
Compare your <code>gnome-plus-i3.session</code> file
with GNOME Flashback&rsquo;s <code>gnome-flashback-metacity.desktop</code>,
remove &ldquo;metacity&rdquo; and anything else you don&rsquo;t like
from the &ldquo;RequiredComponents&rdquo; line,
and add &ldquo;i3&rdquo; in its place.</p>
<p>For step 3, &ldquo;Launch our new session at login&rdquo;,
<code>gnome-session</code> now works via systemd
instead of managing the session itself.
Compare your &ldquo;exec gnome-session &hellip;&rdquo; command
with the one in <code>/usr/lib/gnome-flashback/gnome-flashback-metacity</code>.
You&rsquo;ll also need to copy
<code>/usr/lib/systemd/user/gnome-session-x11@gnome-flashback-metacity.target</code>
to
<code>~/.config/systemd/user/gnome-session-x11@gnome-plus-i3.target</code>.</p>    </body>
