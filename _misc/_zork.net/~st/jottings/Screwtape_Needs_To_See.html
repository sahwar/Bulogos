<p>I have something of a reputation for being immune or indifferent to popular culture; like many things about me it&rsquo;s not so much rebellion as having never gotten around to it. One thing I <em>did</em> once get around to was writing an IRC bot with the ability to store and retrieve facts â€” fairly soon after introducing it to my friends they started stashing all kinds of reminders into it, &ldquo;reminding&rdquo; me to see various things.</p>
<p>The IRC bot broke one day, and I never got around to fixing it, but a friend dug all the &ldquo;Screwtape needs to see&rdquo; messages out of their archives recently, and I thought I&rsquo;d put them up here for posterity.</p>

<p>Most of these I&rsquo;ve seen without reference to the above list. I&rsquo;ll include a comment on each one so you can get an idea of what movies I like. </p>
<ul>
<li>Screwtape needs to see Fight Club<ul>
<li>Not too violent, and deliciously mind-messing-with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to read Snow Crash<ul>
<li>The start of my lengthy Neal Stephenson fandom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see Being John Malkovich<ul>
<li>Poignant, hilarious, and deliciously brain-twisting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see Blade Runner<ul>
<li>I appreciated all the effort put into evoking an atmosphere; I kind of wish I&rsquo;d seen the version with explanatory hard-boiled voice-over. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see Spaceballs<ul>
<li>If it was ever funny, it hasn&rsquo;t aged well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see the composer commentary on The Matrix DVD. it&rsquo;s very good.<ul>
<li>The composer was interesting, I found the backing music incredibly irritating.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see 12 monkeys<ul>
<li>A bit depressing, but well-plotted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see Life of Brian<ul>
<li>As usual with the Pythons, a few really great scenes sandwiched between less-great scenes, and scenes that might have been funnier if I hadn&rsquo;t been hearing them quoted verbatim by fans for twenty years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to watch This Is Spinal Tap<ul>
<li>Kept me amused, but I&rsquo;m more pleased the fact I can say I&rsquo;ve seen it than I was by watching it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see Pirates of the Carribean.<ul>
<li>Great fun, but deep down I wished I were watching The Secret Of Monkey Island: The Movie instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see Bambi vs Godzilla<ul>
<li>I laughed. Twice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tell Screwtape to see Inception.<ul>
<li>A beautifully-executed take on a very old idea, worth going out of your way to see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape needs to see both Bill and Ted movies<ul>
<li>Enjoyable but mindless, probably not worth going out of your way to see.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape = needs to watch Monkey!<ul>
<li>I was very impressed at how many plotlines they had that I&rsquo;d never seen anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Screwtape: you should see Anchorman.<ul>
<li>This was terrible. Even the (very) few jokes that started out funny kept going until they stopped being funny and started being hair-tearingly frustrating.</li>
</ul>
