<p>Game Boy Advance cartridges manufactured by Nintendo use a variety of different
technologies for non-volatile storage (colloquially, &ldquo;save files&rdquo; or &ldquo;save
RAM&rdquo;), and each type works a little differently. For a real cartridge running
on real hardware, there&rsquo;s no problem because Nintendo made sure that each
game cartridge included the kind of storage that the game expected, but for
emulation and preservation things get more complicated.</p>
<p>To start with, let&rsquo;s look at the list of available technologies. As far as we
know, every official GBA cartridge shipped by Nintendo used one of the
following storage technologies, which I will refer to as &ldquo;save types&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing (no save storage at all)</li>
<li>EEPROM with 512 bytes of storage</li>
<li>EEPROM with 8 kilobytes of storage</li>
<li>SRAM (either 32 kilobytes of &ldquo;static RAM&rdquo; with a long-life battery
  attached, or 32 kilobytes of ferro-electric RAM)</li>
<li>Flash RAM with 64 kilobytes of storage</li>
<li>Flash RAM with 128 kilobytes of storage</li>
</ul>
<p>A game designed to work with one kind of storage won&rsquo;t work with the others,
and what&rsquo;s worse is that the hardware interfaces for these storage systems
occupy the same portion of the GBA&rsquo;s memory-map, so it&rsquo;s impossible for an
emulator to emulate more than one at a time. When it boots the software, it
needs to know what storage the game needs, before the game needs it. So what
does it do?</p>
<h2 id="save-codes">Save Codes<a class="headerlink" href="GBA_saves.html#save-codes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In previous Nintendo consoles, like the SNES, there&rsquo;s information in the game&rsquo;s
internal header that specifies the hardware features the game expects to be
present, or at least that can be used to make a reliable educated guess.
Unfortunately, the GBA&rsquo;s internal header does not have any such information.</p>
<p>However, by a happy chance it turns out that the official Nintendo SDK seems to
have shipped with library functions for dealing with different types of save
storage. The code isn&rsquo;t consistent enough to be fingerprinted, but it generally
includes some common byte-strings that the emulator can search for, which
I will refer to as &ldquo;save codes&rdquo;. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>EEPROM_V</code>: Indicates one of the EEPROM save types.</li>
<li><code>SRAM_V</code>: Indicates the SRAM save type.</li>
<li><code>FLASH_V</code>: Indicates the 64 kilobyte Flash RAM save type.</li>
<li><code>FLASH512_V</code>: Also indicates the 64 kilobyte Flash RAM save type (usually found in later games)</li>
<li><code>FLASH1M_V</code>: Indicates the 128 kilobyte Flash RAM save type.</li>
</ul>
<p>These save codes give a pretty good hint about the save code, so if an emulator
scans through the game image looking for one of these codes before booting it
up, it&rsquo;s got a pretty good chance of working. Unfortunately, this is not
a perfect method, for a variety of reasons:</p>
<h2 id="wrinkle-1-games-lie">Wrinkle 1: Games lie<a class="headerlink" href="GBA_saves.html#wrinkle-1-games-lie" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are some games that contain two save codes, but only work with one
specific save-type. There&rsquo;s no reliable heuristic for picking the correct
save-type.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s only one game that contains <em>three</em> save codes, which is &ldquo;Top Gun
- Combat Zones&rdquo;. It is a filthy liar, and if the game detects any of the
storage types described by those save codes, it activates an anti-piracy
routine and prevents you from picking any options in the main menu.</p>
<h2 id="wrinkle-2-eeprom-sizes">Wrinkle 2: EEPROM sizes<a class="headerlink" href="GBA_saves.html#wrinkle-2-eeprom-sizes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s two possible sizes of EEPROM storage, but only one save code for both
of them. Obviously if the emulator sets up an emulated 512-byte storage area,
and the game expects 8 kilobytes of storage, that&rsquo;s not going to work out too
well.</p>
<p>Due to the particular protocol used by the EEPROM storage systems in GBA
cartridges, an emulator can pretty reliably guess what storage size a game
expects to use before the game actually reads or writes any data, so this isn&rsquo;t
a terrible limitation. It&rsquo;s still added complexity, however.</p>
<h2 id="wrinkle-3-flash-manufacturer-codes">Wrinkle 3: Flash manufacturer codes<a class="headerlink" href="GBA_saves.html#wrinkle-3-flash-manufacturer-codes" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The GBA was far from the only device that supported Flash RAM for storage;
manufacturers of Compact Flash cards and SD cards and USB thumb-drives were all
churning out Flash RAM chips as fast as they could. Although each
manufacturer&rsquo;s chips behaved in more or less the same way at the electrical
level, at the software level they all expected the instructions to read or
write data in different, manufacturer specific formats. Software written to
store information to one brand of Flash RAM chips wouldn&rsquo;t work at all with
Flash RAM chips from another manufacturer.</p>
<p>Nintendo came up with a reasonable solution to this problem: As best I can make
out, the story went something like this: they would buy batches of Flash RAM
chips from a few manufacturers, then add support for those Flash RAM chips into
their official SDK, and send it out to the game developers whose games were
scheduled to be manufactured in the near future. At start up, the code in the
SDK would talk to the Flash chip and say &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your manufacturer code?&rdquo; and
use the protocol corresponding to that manufacturer. When Nintendo&rsquo;s
cartridge-factories began to run out of Flash RAM chips, they&rsquo;d buy more
batches from whichever manufacturer had the best deal, and remove support for
the previous manufacturer&rsquo;s chips from the SDK and replace it with the new.</p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that if a GBA game is designed for one of the Flash
RAM save types, the first thing it will do is ask the emulated Flash RAM
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s your manufacturer code&rdquo;, and there are half a dozen or so possible
answers, some of which will be accepted and some of which will cause error
messages or maybe even a crash&hellip; and exactly <em>which</em> codes are accepted
changes from one game to the next.</p>
<h2 id="solution-a-save-type-database">Solution: a save-type database<a class="headerlink" href="GBA_saves.html#solution-a-save-type-database" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Every GBA emulator with reasonable compatibility has some kind of database that
specifies save-type information. Some emulators, like
<a href="http://vba-m.com/">VBA-M</a> have carefully-chosen defaults with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/vbam/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/src/vba-over.ini">a list of
exceptions</a>,
while <a href="http://www.mamedev.org/">MAME</a> tries to be
<a href="http://mamedev.org/source/hash/gba.xml.html">exhaustive</a>. Unfortunately, none
that I&rsquo;ve found actually guarantees that every game has been tested, and none
of them seem to include Flash RAM manufacturer code information, so reliably
emulating GBA games is still somewhat difficult.</p>
