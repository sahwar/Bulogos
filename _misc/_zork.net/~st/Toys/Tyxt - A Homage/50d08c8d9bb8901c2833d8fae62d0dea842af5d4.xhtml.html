		<p>Pushing open the door of the domed building, you slip inside as the door closes behind you. The building is one large, circular room, with bare stone walls and floor; directly in the center is a large padded seat that looks uncommonly like a dentistâ€™s chair (although none of the obligatory medieval torture devices are in evidence). The room is dimly lit by a series of spotlights around the edge of the ceiling, bathing the inside of the domed roof in a milky, indistinct glow.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="c61fa036719d5ac19c325e46f4f3f959d23e147b.xhtml.html">Sit in the chair</a> or<br></br> <a href="461e346546786911a5de4149113b560bdba18e54.xhtml.html">Leave the Planetarium</a>.</p>
