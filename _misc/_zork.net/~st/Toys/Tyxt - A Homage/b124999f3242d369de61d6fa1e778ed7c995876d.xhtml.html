		<p>A painting hangs upon the wall, depicting the view from inside a dimly-lit room to an even more dimly-lit passageway. Although the painting is very well executed, you can't see much artistic merit in it - until suddenly you notice that the woodgrain panelling in the picture's walls is very similar to the panelling in the room you're standing in. Whatâ€™s more, below the low plank you took to be a stair is the top-halves of some books, as though it's actually a book-case that has sunk through the floor.</p><p>You glance at the bookshelf in the library - it doesn't *look* movable...</p><p><a href="7965bc7f18b10cf0037084d11612bb0cf5ebf5b6.xhtml.html">Look around the Library</a>.</p>
