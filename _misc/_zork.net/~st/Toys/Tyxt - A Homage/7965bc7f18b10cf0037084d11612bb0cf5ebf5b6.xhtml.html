		<p>The cool shade of the library is much more comfortable than the heat of the sun outside. You pace over the polished wooden floor, which (despite there being no door to protect it from the weather) is immaculate. Above your head a candelabra illuminates a domed ceiling, painted to look like the sky. Around the walls of the library are a number of interesting things: a low bookshelf, two small reading tables (one with a red book, one with a blue book), two paintings (one looking out a doorway, one looking in), a map, a fireplace, and of course an exit to the outside world.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="519c69565428a6c5c365b29bdf6181fbf40baba1.xhtml.html">Examine the bookshelf</a>,<br></br> <a href="a16ee7f19e005e2e7f11c13fee56fd0c2089daa0.xhtml.html">Examine the reading table with the red book</a>,<br></br> <a href="56c724be06e5318692a5961624939221d13a2628.xhtml.html">Examine the reading table with the blue book</a>,<br></br> <a href="1c88dcff28ddad9bcd7c94c1c7c6bc3b88d75a31.xhtml.html">Examine the ‘looking out’ painting.</a>,<br></br> <a href="b124999f3242d369de61d6fa1e778ed7c995876d.xhtml.html">Examine the ‘looking in’ painting.</a>,<br></br> <a href="ada51fe0dd723c22e0ace93f3b0bfce1f9363a70.xhtml.html">Examine the map</a>,<br></br> <a href="9c0ee79564cfddb5ffa29ec20b32a5a80fc9682d.xhtml.html">Examine the fireplace</a> or<br></br> <a href="461e346546786911a5de4149113b560bdba18e54.xhtml.html">Leave the library</a>.</p>
