		<p>A small reading table sits here, bearing a single book bound in battered blue leather. The cover isn't the only thing damaged about this book, it looks like a number of pages have been torn out - in fact, a pale-blue page on the shelf next to the book looks like it might belong.</p><p><a href="7965bc7f18b10cf0037084d11612bb0cf5ebf5b6.xhtml.html">Look around the Library</a>.</p>
