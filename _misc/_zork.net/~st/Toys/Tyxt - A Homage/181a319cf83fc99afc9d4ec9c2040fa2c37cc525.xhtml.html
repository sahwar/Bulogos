		<p>The dock you saw in the book now stands beneath your feet, as detailed and vivid as ever. The clouds you glimpsed now glide effortlessly above you, and you can feel the warmth of the sun. Beneath the dock, you hear the sound of waves gently washing around the pylons and against the shore.</p><p>Directly ahead, you can see a set of stairs that lead up to the rest of the island. Looking out to sea, you can see the sad, rotting remains of an old sailing-ship, deeply submerged except for the tips of her masts. Looking back at the island, the steep shoreline prevents you from seeing much - but much of the cliff has been plated with iron, and a small iron door promises access to interesting things within.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="bf71305b1b806f86b95243527b313ae5fded4dd2.xhtml.html">Wander over to the stairs</a> or<br></br> <a href="6db111dd09a78203dd26cd185a9e1dccc27154b9.xhtml.html">Push open the small iron door</a>.</p>
