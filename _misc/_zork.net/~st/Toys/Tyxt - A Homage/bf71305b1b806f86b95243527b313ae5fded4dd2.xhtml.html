		<p>A tightly-coiled set of stairs nestles between the dock and the rockier extremes of the island - conveniently enough there’s even little night-lights on each step so you can find your way in the dark, although you’re not sure how they’re powered. A little way up, the stairs pause at a sort of paved promenade that runs parallel to the dock, before continuing to wind their way up to a sort of platform built on a huge rocky outcrop. The promenade connects to the rest of island, while the platform looks to contain a pile of enormous gears. The dock extends along a straight stretch of shoreline, with an iron wall on one side and sparkling sea on the other.</p><p>You may:<br></br> <a href="2ccec601d04824b5aa97cee5733f2721f7bc4058.xhtml.html">Walk up to the promenade</a>,<br></br> <a href="db2e6f049816fbf858ac2ed42214cbcc13306ffc.xhtml.html">Climb up to the giant gears</a> or<br></br> <a href="181a319cf83fc99afc9d4ec9c2040fa2c37cc525.xhtml.html">Walk out along the dock</a>.</p>
