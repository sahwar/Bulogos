		<p>The sound of the sea grows dim as you climb down a short flight of stairs, and you enter a small chamber. Although itâ€™s too regular to be anything but man-made, the chamber is in no way crude: the floor is smooth and carpeted, the roof (although low) is gently dome-shaped, and six generous alcoves line the walls, empty but for dim yellowish lights whose glow somehow complements the cool, quiet solitude of this place. In the centre of the room sits a squat black cauldron that appears to be bubbling away merrily - except that you can see no flames, feel no heat, and hear no noise.</p><p><a href="6db111dd09a78203dd26cd185a9e1dccc27154b9.xhtml.html">Go back to the passage</a>.</p>
