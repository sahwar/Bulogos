Although the painting is very well executed, you can't see much artistic merit in it - until suddenly you realise that the doorway in the painting is the doorway of the library, and the garden is the island you've been exploring.</p><p>Why would someone hang a picture of a doorway in a room that contains the very same thing?</p><p><a href="7965bc7f18b10cf0037084d11612bb0cf5ebf5b6.xhtml.html">Look around the Library</a>.</p>
