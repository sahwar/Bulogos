* Mozilla Firefox v60+/v67+(?) will remove support for the FTP/FTPS/SFTP protocol?!? ðŸ˜¢ðŸ¤® But why? Even if it is an insecure protocol by contemporary (2020) standards, you can just still include FTP support in the browser BUT have a WARNING page about insecure protocol&a disclaimer of warranty if the user still wishes to open the FTP webpage. And also add a switch in Mozilla Firefox's `about:config` to even remove the warning pre-webpage for people who are okay with using a sorta insecure connection. Don't just remove support for FTP completely!!! I mean, a web-browser is about browsing HTTP/HTTPS & FTP/FTPS/SFTP webpages!!!

However, I mostly really love the new Firefox UI/GUI/UX, inspired by Google Chrome BUT still offering the most features and much more customization that that found in Google Chrome! Kudos (Congratulations) to the Firefox UI-revamp team!
I also greatly enjoy the new multi-process Firefox having a task-manager for tabs&windows(&private such) like Google Chrome does!
I also greatly enjoy the availability of Firefox ESR (extended support release, like Ubuntu Linux's LTS (Long-term support) release - in contrast with rolling-release distros!).
I also greatly enjoy stable x64 releases of Firefox (Quantum) and the cutting-edge 2 separate branches of Firefox (one for webdev professionals and th latest-git unstable edition for testing!)
The only minus is that Firefox is a memory hog for too much RAM if you have more than 5 tabs simultaneously opened,
and so users of older PCs are forced to use OLDER versions of Firefox or more lightweight web-browsers like uzbl or suckless.org's webkit-based browser or other browsers (e.g. inspired by the Vimperator add-on plus Firefox's v65+(?) new UI).
* Debian Linux will remove support for older drivers?!?

But why?!?
Just put those drivers in a package in the `non-free` or `contrib` repositories and add instructions on how to automagically include those by using a simple CLI commmandline switch at install time (which may require Internet access to download the drivers!).
* Debian to remove its FTP servers - again, bad decision, I hope that they at least keep the HTTP(S) & torrent downloads, and introduce ADC/DC++ download mirrors:

* JSON NOT officially supporting comments so people are forced to use various hacks or mods of JSON...
* ?
* Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox NOT natively supporting saving webpages as .WARC (latest stable git version), and as .mht (like IE10â€“11 did; + the Firefox add-on UnMHT), and as .MAFF (via the Firefox MAFF add-on).
However, it is nice that Google Chrome (desktop&mobile) supports saving webpages as .mht (maybe???) and that Firefox mobile (for Google Android) supports printing webpages as PDF, like Google Chrome (desktop) does.
* wget, wget2, curl, lftp, httpie, etc. should also support saving webpages as .WARC (latest stable-git), as .mht, and as .htm/.html+{webpage title, with all non-html external resources inside}_folder folder, and as .MAFF, and printing to PDF (with included PDF-attachment = the original webpage in the aforementioned web-archival DataHoarding long-term-storage file-format filetypes)...
* Mozilla Firefox & Google Chrome NOT including a local .html (English+other locale language) of their help pages with the list of keyboard shortcuts, computer-mouse&mouse-gestures shortcuts, and list of about:{something} internal web-browser settings webpages... and also NOT including the Keyboard Shortcuts Editor by default inside the web-browser... and NOT including a DONATE button in the web-browser, and NOT shipping by default the Ctrl+Shift+D 'Save all opened tabs as {user-typed_datetime}' folder + export all saved bookmarks as .html/.commonmark/.json + Copy All Opened Tab URIs/URLs (&/titles) to clipboard/.txt/.json/.html/.commonmark - for both desktop&mobile web-browsers.
* to add more later on...
