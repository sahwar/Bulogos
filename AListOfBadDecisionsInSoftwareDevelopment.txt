* Mozilla Firefox v60+/v67+(?) will remove support for the FTP/FTPS/SFTP protocol?!? üò¢ü§Æ But why? Even if it is an insecure protocol by contemporary (2020) standards, you can just still include FTP support in the browser BUT have a WARNING page about insecure protocol&a disclaimer of warranty if the user still wishes to open the FTP webpage. And also add a switch in Mozilla Firefox's `about:config` to even remove the warning pre-webpage for people who are okay with using a sorta insecure connection. Don't just remove support for FTP completely!!! I mean, a web-browser is about browsing HTTP/HTTPS & FTP/FTPS/SFTP webpages!!!

However, I mostly really love the new Firefox UI/GUI/UX, inspired by Google Chrome BUT still offering the most features and much more customization that that found in Google Chrome! Kudos (Congratulations) to the Firefox UI-revamp team!
I also greatly enjoy the new multi-process Firefox having a task-manager for tabs&windows(&private such) like Google Chrome does!
I also greatly enjoy the availability of Firefox ESR (extended support release, like Ubuntu Linux's LTS (Long-term support) release - in contrast with rolling-release distros!).
I also greatly enjoy stable x64 releases of Firefox (Quantum) and the cutting-edge 2 separate branches of Firefox (one for webdev professionals and th latest-git unstable edition for testing!)
The only minus is that Firefox is a memory hog for too much RAM if you have more than 5 tabs simultaneously opened,
and so users of older PCs are forced to use OLDER versions of Firefox or more lightweight web-browsers like uzbl or suckless.org's webkit-based browser or other browsers (e.g. inspired by the Vimperator add-on plus Firefox's v65+(?) new UI).
* Debian Linux will remove support for older drivers?!?

https://fossbytes.com/debian-gnu-linux-legacy-drivers-remove/
But why?!?
Just put those drivers in a package in the `non-free` or `contrib` repositories and add instructions on how to automagically include those by using a simple CLI commmandline switch at install time (which may require Internet access to download the drivers!).
* Debian to remove its FTP servers - again, bad decision, I hope that they at least keep the HTTP(S) & torrent downloads, and introduce ADC/DC++&metalink download mirrors:

* JSON NOT officially supporting comments so people are forced to use various hacks or mods of JSON...
* ?
* Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox NOT natively supporting saving webpages as .WARC (latest stable git version), and as .mht (like IE10‚Äì11 did; + the Firefox add-on UnMHT), and as .MAFF (via the Firefox MAFF add-on).
However, it is nice that Google Chrome (desktop&mobile) supports saving webpages as .mht (maybe???) and that Firefox mobile (for Google Android) supports printing webpages as PDF, like Google Chrome (desktop) does.
* wget, wget2, curl, lftp, httpie, etc. should also support saving webpages as .WARC (latest stable-git), as .mht, and as .htm/.html+{webpage title, with all non-html external resources inside}_folder folder, and as .MAFF, and printing to PDF (with included PDF-attachment = the original webpage in the aforementioned web-archival DataHoarding long-term-storage file-format filetypes)...
* Mozilla Firefox & Google Chrome NOT including a local .html (English+other locale language) of their help pages with the list of keyboard shortcuts, computer-mouse&mouse-gestures shortcuts, and list of about:{something} internal web-browser settings webpages... and also NOT including the Keyboard Shortcuts Editor by default inside the web-browser... and NOT including a DONATE button in the web-browser, and NOT shipping by default the Ctrl+Shift+D 'Save all opened tabs as {user-typed_datetime}' folder + export all saved bookmarks as .html/.commonmark/.json + Copy All Opened Tab URIs/URLs (&/titles) to clipboard/.txt/.json/.html/.commonmark - for both desktop&mobile web-browsers.
* modern smartphones NOT having a replaceable (rechargable) battery & NOT supporting file-sharing/synching to USB-connected HDDs/SSDs/USB-flashsticks and NOT supporting USB3toSATA connection...
* newer non-smartphone dumbphones/feature phones NOT supporting basic VoIP/video-conferencing/UTF-8+color-emoji live-messaging chatting&p2p-filesharing&access to remote FTP/WebDAV/HTTP/p2p servers, and NOT supporting voice-input, extensible speech-synthesis app, advanced multilingual updateable IME inputting (keyboard layouts, handwriting recognition, voice-input/speech-recognition/voice-control), and NOT supporting live webcast broadcasting, and USB&Bluetooth connections, and LAN-p2p-filesharing/chatting/videoconferencing-audio-VoIP, and NOT shipping by default with a basic HTML5 web-browser with synching options... AND NOT having dual-language GSM keyboard layouts on the physical keys of the featurephone, and NOT being mod-ready&modular... , etc.
* Not necessarily a bad software decision, but just bad software:
Windows 8 (before Windows 8.1 kinda fixed it),
and Windows 10X ( https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic ) :
Windows10 sucks unless you are into AAA-gaming and want an improved/changed/revamped Windows Explorer and Task Manager,
and some newer hardware drivers; Only go for Windows10 Pro (x64), ditch/forget about Windows10 Home, and
also, Windows10X is mostly crap (like Google ChromeOS netbooks but supporting Win32/WUP apps!) made just for the low-powered netbook devices...
* Google Android M - it will only be usable after it is made into a lightweight clone of macOS and Ubuntu/Debian Linux, otherwise it is
just a Google Android (based on&running a Linux kernel) with a Win98/XP/7/8.1/10 START menu and capable of running Google Android apps from Google Play store& from f-droid.org, with some support for desktop Linux apps ...
* In 2020, the immensely popular Linux Mint distro supposedly dropped support for Ubuntu snappy snaps packages instead of just adding a simple CLI-app & GUI app to handle snap packages, and also such an app for AppImage packages and flatpak packages...
* Microsoft NOT sending the full complete source-code of Windows 7 Pro/Ultimate x86+x86_64's + binary .iso's (all locales + all updates up to the last ESR releases pre-installed minus the Windows10-backported spyware KBs and the serial-key-checking KB updates) to the FSF as requested by RMS: https://www.kaldata.com/it-%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8/fsf-%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0-microsoft-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BD-%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4-%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%82-329370.html?amp
* Debian Linux & Arch Linux removing 32-bit builds upon which people with older hardware depended - sucks ass - they should just release 32-bit builds as unofficial forks of their main 64-bit amd64&ARM-v6+-x64 builds...
* people NOT knowing about NTP online time-synchronization servers & about THAT freeware MS-Windows app that lets you modify the datetime stamps of files&folders... üòÅüòúüëç
* etc.
* useful .bat scripts for MS-Windows cmd.exe and cmdlets for MS-Windows PowerShellCore, similar to Linux/*NIX shell-scripting (mainly for bash&zsh).
* to add more later on...
