html2txt

There are many html2txt parsers out there, including pandoc, xml/sgml-based, etc. (as well as reverse-function tools: pdf2htmlEX, img2pdf, WARC/WebArchive & archive.org / archive.is , etc.), but of the popular ones as of 11-March-2022, only the below tool has a very user-friendly function to also include all references and to numerically cite them (but maybe it should also support html2commonmark via pandoc, while retaining the extra functions of its html2txt tool? ðŸ¤” ), which is extremely essential for a good Unicode/UTF-8-text-only representation of any .html/.xhtml/.xml webpage (though dynamic/DHTML/AJAX/async/client-side-webapps/online singlepage-apps - may not work correctly due to requiring user-action via a webbrowser or by a scriptable AHK2 or scriptable headless-webbrowser like PhantomJS, Mozilla SpiderMonkey&Rust-based-new-Firefox-Gecko-engine, etc.)!!!

(I wonder if they have that tools' source-code over at http://github.com or at non-Micro$oft http://gitlab.org or at some publicly-accessible gitea instance... hmmm... Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome should support that html2txt tool by default as well as support a MS Edge/IE11-compatible .mht/.mhtml and also support WARC, and optional piping of saving of an individual webpage - to curl, wget, wget2, httpie, lftp, xget (github.com, NOT the irc dcc tool!...)
