Text based mail reader (but it DOES support Unicode (UTF-8)-encoded emails, BUT I am not sure about HTML-/HTML5-based emails since that requires a non-headless web-browser to display/render it like a webpage...)

Mutt is a text based mail user agent that supports MIME, PGP/MIME, POP3, IMAP, threading, and color. Its default keybindings are much like elm, but keybindings are fully configurable; Mush and PINE-like ones are provided as examples. It handles MMDF, MH, and maildir in addition to regular mbox format. Messages may be indefinitely postponed. The program overall is configurable through an rc file.

SAY _OKAY_ TO HTML/HTML5-formatted (rich-text) emails?

MAYBE. I actually don't mind those as long as the spam emails & nasty binary-files
virus attachment-files ARE NOT fucking up my email inbox! ---https://github.com/sahwar/Bulogos & http://sites.google.com/view/ve4ernik
BUT MOST SECURITY-ORIENTED PEOPLE PREFER PLAINTEXT TXT-ONLY EMAILS & .asc-signed
with GnuPG, etc. (This is the personal opinion of https://github.com/sahwar/Bulogos , also known as http://sites.google.com/view/ve4ernik )
