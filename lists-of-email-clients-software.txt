Text based mail reader

Mutt is a text based mail user agent that supports MIME, PGP/MIME, POP3, IMAP, threading, and color. Its default keybindings are much like elm, but keybindings are fully configurable; Mush and PINE-like ones are provided as examples. It handles MMDF, MH, and maildir in addition to regular mbox format. Messages may be indefinitely postponed. The program overall is configurable through an rc file.

OK TO HTML/HTML5-formatted (rich-text) emails?

virus attachment-files ARE NOT fucking up my email inbox! ---https://github.com/sahwar/Bulogos & http://sites.google.com/view/ve4ernik
BUT MOST SECURITY-ORIENTED PEOPLE PREFER PLAINTEXT TXT-ONLY EMAILS & .asc-signed
