Examples of the various applications of this novel divergence/convergence emerging tech:

* image super-resolution rescalers, e.g. Waifu2x and similar
* pattern-/model-/template-driven image repainters:
DeepNet, Google DeepDream & Google make-uploaded/url-pasted-images-to-transform-into-the-art-style-of-popular-art-movements/art-painters/popular-artworks/etc.
* updating tesseract/tasseract-OCR &OCRoReader & machine-learning/machine-vision OCR-like handwriting recognition & scanning of old print manuscripts and graphical cleanup/smoothing/smudging/small-blurring of visual JPEG-artifacts
* reconstructing panorama views by stitching together Hudgin/Hugin
* redrawing images, including coloring/recoloring-restoring/reconstructing-color-version-from-greyscale-tones&microscopic-nano-patterns-in-oldschool-paper-laid-photos in old greyscale/Sepia-toned photographs
* doing overlay-driven outlines/redrawings of images and digital retouching & recoloring
* reCAPTCHA systems for verify-that-you-are-human IQ-like-pattern-manipulation&recognition&remixing tests & 'MBTI/MBP(I)T'
* entertainment 'aging'-of-your-face&body-photos apps
* shit-use 'beautification'/de-mogrification apps of your dating-profile photos, etc.

* practically near-unlimited applications, including many artistic&creative uses, etc.



>>> NO to TOO MUCH of Elon Musk's Neuralink R&D due to heightened extinction-risk!!! OTHERWISE IF IT SORTA SUCCEEDS => high-tech dystopia

The better alternative presented by me, ve4ernik, is this:

wearable IoT/AR&VR micro-computer super-computers linked to bigger sturdy durable super-computers elsewhere...

Examples:
Google Lens, the wearable on-head visor-tech computer worn by the black character in the Westworld (season 3) TV series!!!; etc.
+ _NON-MANDATORY VOLUNTARY-ONLY_ in-brain/below-skin micro-chip hooked to the Internet via satellites, like in the transhumanist TV series Intelligence (2014) & Person of Interest (2011-)...
