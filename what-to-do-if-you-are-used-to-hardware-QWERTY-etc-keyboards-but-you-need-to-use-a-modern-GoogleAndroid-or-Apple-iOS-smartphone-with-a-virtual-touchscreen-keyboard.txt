* Solution 1 (cheapest): You can buy a Nokia smartphone with Google Android (even a working 2nd-hand one will do!), BUT the models which feature a physical QWERTY keyboard on them!

* Solution 2 (also quite cheap):
You can just buy a cheap durable full Bluetooth-connection QWERTY keyboard and use it with your smartphone via Bluetooth, and just carry it in a laptop bag with you. (Or a USB-C-cable hardware keyboard for Google Android smartphones which support hooking up a hardware keyboard via the USB-C port).

* Solution 3: 
Just buy a non-PRC-China-produced smartphone which INCLUDES a small QWERTY keyboard!!!
This is a UK company which produces this excellent smartphone:

Extra:
Solution 4: If you REALLY want a very durable tough smartphone, buy a 2nd smartphone from CAT with a screen of at least 720p - they are all IP65 and very tough and most of these models can withstand falling on the ground a couple of times.

Solution 5: If you are an old person, you can buy a contemporary simple feature phone or dumbphone which has big durable hardware keys and is designed for elderly people and people with big fingers on their hands!!! Just google to do your research. Several such inventions were crowdfunded by indiegogo, gofundme, kickstarter, etc.

P.S. In any case, go for a tough durable protector no matter what smartphone you have!
And also buy a necklace-worn laptop/smartphone/wallet durable tough bag to carry all of these (but I suppose that your wallet and ID are better off in your jacket or pants!).
And make sure to ALWAYS activate your GPS and your activated http://find.android.com 'Find Drvive' app for Google Android smartphones when you leave your smartphones unattended and away from you for a long period of time, and password-protected with passwords which you remember/memorized well. üëç That ensures that you can find your smartphone in case you lose it or it gets stolen - as long as it is on and has some battery charge and has GPS on and that 'Find device' app activated, you can locate the GPS coordinates of the lost/stolen smartphone (and they can't easily unlock it when you have a password on it, but they can charge it via a USB cable and they may possibly be able to factory-reset it if they are great hackers...).

WARNING: ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT FORGET YOUR SMARTPHONES' LOGIN PASSWORDS OR YOU WILL HAVE TO FACTORY-RESET THEM AND THAT WILL LOSE ALL OF YOUR DATA ON THEM (EXCEPT FOR DATA BACKUP ED TO GOOGLE DRIVE, APPLE CLOUD, MICROSOFT ONEDRIVE, MEDIAFIRE.COM, DROPBOX.COM, ETC., BUT THOSE CLOUD STORAGE PLACES ARE _NOT_ AS RELIABLE AS HAVING YOUR OWN DATETIME-STAMPED BACKUPS OF LL YOUR SMARTPHONES' IMPORTANT FILES ON YOUR PHYSICAL EXTERNAL HDDs/SSDs (you can also encrypt those HDDs/SSDs, BUT if you forget the passwords for them, your are NOT gonna open them!!!).
P.P.S. Always have a laptop with an external HDD/SSD attached to it and BACKUP all your important files on your smartphones at the end of every week or at the end of every month! Use your smartphone's Calendar app to schedule a whole-day-event reminder for you about that BACKUP ALL MY IMPORTANT FILES ON MY SMARTPHONE TO EXTERNAL LAPTOP-ATTACHED HDD/SSD TODAY routine!
