Major hardware architectures/platforms for 2010-2020+:
	x86_64 (amd64, x86-64, 64-bit x86), x86 (i386-noPAE, i386-PAE, i686-noPAE, i686-PAE, ...), ARM, ARM64 (ARMv5-6-7-8+?)

Major release models:
	* USB-/CD-DVD-(live-media)-booting --- .ISO live-image for burning to CD/DVD/USB-flashstick/memory-card (= LiveCD/LiveDVD/LiveUSB) - obtained/got/downloaded from official Internet online HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/torrent/magnet/DC++&ADC/XDCC/etc. downloads via major online download mirrors of Linux distros and from major Linux-kernel & Linux-distro software-projects-hosting websites..., e.g. kernel.org, SourceForge.net, github.com, gitlab.com / gitlab.org, freshcode.com, fosshub.com, ibiblio.org, ftp.sourceware.org, etc.
	Both BIOS and UEFI booting are now available, with Secure Boot.
	`added additional support of Sparky installation on UEFI machines with Secure Boot: the live system should be launched with Secure Boot off as before, but after installation the Secure Boot can be turned on, both installers: Calamares and Sparky's Advanced provides support of such installation; disabled package list updating, during installing Sparky via Calamares, even you install Sparky with active Internet connection, the Debian or Sparky server can be temporary off, so it could stop the installation.`
	persistent LiveUSB/LiveCD+RW/LiveDVD+RW for /home/ dir & or full-SystemMagicKit???
	Support for libreboot and/or coreboot --- http://initfreedom.org (see http://devuan.org )
	* physical transfer via the .ISO being already installed on a CD/DVD/USB-flashstick/memory-card (can be obtained from the above or manually self-made/self-modified by programmers)
	* download via Network-install from a semi-full physical media (USB-flashstick/CD/DVD), including for downloading of extra packages, localization language packs, bugfixes, updates, upgrades, NTP-network-datetime-synchronization, etc.
	
Minor release models:
	OTA (over-the-air) via GSM/2G/3G/4G(/5G+) mobile-data-carrier companies _and_ via full-duplex p2p-LAN-sharing, or via Tunngle/Wippien/LogMeIn Hamachi-like _LAN-multiplayer-videogaming-over-Internet/Ethernet_ (etc.) (i.e. unidirectional LAN-filesharing); via WiFi Direct filesharing, or via Bluetooth/IR/NFC/Chakra-/Miracast_or_DLNA filesharing / screencasting (?), etc.

1. incremental Internet-based/Internet-downloaded-and-updated-offline-with-the-diff-updates updates via ROLLING RELEASE model, e.g. Debian, ArchLinux (really?), Knoppix, Dynabolic, , etc.

2. Ubuntu-Linux-like LTS (long-term-support) mostly-static-except-security-bugfixes & 1-or-2-per-year non-LTS releases with the latest stable-OR-bleeding-edge appication software & 
latest stable Linux kernel. The online Internet HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/SFTP/DC++&ADC/XDCC/ONIONSHARE/TORRENT-OR-MAGNET-URI/etc. downloads & the software development uses version-control-systems, e.g. git, github.com, gitlab.org, gitea, etc. & utilizes IRC/IM chat-systems & email lists for development of the distro/OS programming source-code, and for feedback from end-users, etc + live meetup hackathon events with prizes, collaborations, etc. ...
Example: Updated ISO Hybrid with UEFI support

3. Static [builds] OSs (downloaded as Docker or Virtual box package for virtualization, or run from a physical media - CD/DVD/BluRay/USB-flashsttick/magnetic-tape-drives/HDDs/SSDs/etc.), intended to be mostly used offline due to 'frozen' release with no security patches.
Examples: Linux from Scratch (?), Minimal Linux Live, AntiX, MX Linux (really?), non-LTS Ubuntu & Debian (really?), SliTaz (really? I think that this one is a rolling-release Linux distro!), etc.

These may still be updated manually by the end-user BY WRITING YOUR OWN DAMN PROGRAMMING CODE, BUGFIX-TESTING/TROUBLSESHOOTING IT, IMPLEMENTING IT, COMPILING IT, AND SUCCESSFULLY RUNNING IT, OR BY ASKING OTHER PEOPLE TO WRITE THE CODE FOR YOU, either for free, or for money/gphysical-goods-exchange&=bartering/OR for sex, services, information, teaching/tutoring!!!, etc.

'Musix, a GNU+Linux distribution based on Knoppix, with special emphasis on audio production. __This is a “static” distro, normally run from a live CD. Since it will not receive security updates, it should be used offline.__Removed March 2019. Removed at the request of the maintainer, as they had stopped maintaining it.
'

4. A rolling release distro model (like Debian(?) and Arch Linux), including weird ones based on LTS editions of Ubuntu Linux:

I only support http://github.com despite Microsoft buying it...
