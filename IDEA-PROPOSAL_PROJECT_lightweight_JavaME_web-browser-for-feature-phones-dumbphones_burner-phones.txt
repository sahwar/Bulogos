IDEA:

JavaME lightweight webkit2 web browser for dumbphones/burner phones/old mobile phones/feature phones
Inspired by http://suckless.org surf web-browser and by uzbl and vimium, etc.
The main killer feature is:
zooming in/out the HTML5 webpage (all / or only text), and support fora mouse/touchpad-like cursor controlled by the feature phone's 4+1 arrow-keys buttonsðŸ“±ðŸ“ž,
plus support for whole-app GUI panning and webpage-canvas-area panning (moving around the zoomed in/out webpage)
and support for SEVERAL quantization/pixel-art/resizing algorithms for the zooming in/out;
Support for 2+scrollwheel+scrollwheel-click computer-mouse-emulated cursor buttons and 2-3 in-app programmable hardware / software buttons , etc. ...
Support for:
http, https, ftp, sftp, ftps, gopher, IRC-XDCC, magnet-links(/libtorrent, DC++/ADC?), WebRTC_via_webcam-streaming-to-animated-GIF_webchat+p2p-filesharing, etc. ...
Maybe based on (a working subset of?) Brave-browser or WebKit, or Chromium_???, or on Firefox Servo web-browser engine


( vnc/RDP/NX/TeamViewerWebUI and ssh&ftp for JavaME???)
