<tt>PREFACE <br>
At the end </tt>of his review of my first book, <i>Code: And Other Laws of <br>
Cyberspace, </i>David Pogue, a brilliant writer and author of countless <br>
technical and computer-related texts, wrote this: <br>
</p><p>
Unlike actual law, Internet software has no capacity to punish. It <br>
doesn't affect people who aren't online (and only a tiny minority <br>
of the world population is). And if you don't like the Internet's <br>
system, you can always flip off the modem. 1 <br>
</p><p>
Pogue was skeptical of the core argument of the book&mdash;that soft-ware, <br>
or "code," functioned as a kind of law&mdash;and his review suggested <br>
the happy thought that if life in cyberspace got bad, we could always <br>
"drizzle, drazzle, druzzle, drome"-like simply flip a switch and be back <br>
home. Turn off the modem, unplug the computer, and any troubles <br>
that exist in <i>that </i>space wouldn't "affect" us anymore. <br>
Pogue might have been right in 1999&mdash;I'm skeptical, but maybe. <br>
But even if he was right then, the point is not right now: <i>Free Culture <br>
</i>is about the troubles the Internet causes even after the modem is turned <br>

<br>

off. It is an argument about how the battles that now rage regarding life <br>
on-line have fundamentally affected "people who aren't online." There <br>
is no switch that will insulate us from the Internet's effect. <br>
But unlike <i>Code, </i>the argument here is not much about the Internet <br>
itself. It is instead about the consequence of the Internet to a part of <br>
our tradition that is much more fundamental, and, as hard as this is for <br>
a geek-wanna-be to admit, much more important. <br>
That tradition is the way our culture gets made. As I explain in the <br>
pages that follow, we come from a tradition of "free culture"&mdash;not <br>
"free" as in "free beer" (to borrow a phrase from the founder of the free-software <br>
movement 2 ), but "free" as in "free speech," "free markets," "free <br>
trade," "free enterprise," "free will," and "free elections." A free culture <br>
supports and protects creators and innovators. It does this directly by <br>
granting intellectual property rights. But it does so indirectly by limit-ing <br>
the reach of those rights, to guarantee that follow-on creators and <br>
innovators remain <i>as free as possible </i>from the control of the past. A free <br>
culture is not a culture without property, just as a free market is not a <br>
market in which everything is free. The opposite of a free culture is a <br>
"permission culture"&mdash;a culture in which creators get to create only <br>
with the permission of the powerful, or of creators from the past. <br>
If we understood this change, I believe we would resist it. Not "we" <br>
on the Left or "you" on the Right, but we who have no stake in the <br>
particular industries of culture that defined the twentieth century. <br>
Whether you are on the Left or the Right, if you are in this sense dis-interested, <br>
then the story I tell here will trouble you. For the changes I <br>
describe affect values that both sides of our political culture deem fun-damental. <br>
</p><p>
We saw a glimpse of this bipartisan outrage in the early summer of <br>
2003. As the FCC considered changes in media ownership rules that <br>
would relax limits on media concentration, an extraordinary coalition <br>
generated more than 700,000 letters to the FCC opposing the change. <br>
As William Safire described marching "uncomfortably alongside <br>
CodePink Women for Peace and the National Rifle Association, be-<br>

tween liberal Olympia Snowe and conservative Ted Stevens," he for-mulated <br>
perhaps most simply just what was at stake: the concentration <br>
of power. And as he asked, <br>
</p><p>
Does that sound unconservative? Not to me. The concentration <br>
of power&mdash;political, corporate, media, cultural&mdash;should be anath-ema <br>
to conservatives. The diffusion of power through local con-trol, <br>
thereby encouraging individual participation, is the essence <br>
of federalism and the greatest expression of democracy. 3 <br>
</p><p>
This idea is an element of the argument of <i>Free Culture, </i>though my <br>
focus is not just on the concentration of power produced by concentra-tions <br>
in ownership, but more importantly, if because less visibly, on the <br>
concentration of power produced by a radical change in the effective <br>
scope of the law. The law is changing; that change is altering the way our <br>
culture gets made; that change should worry you&mdash;whether or not you <br>
care about the Internet, and whether you're on Safire's left or on his right. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>The inspiration </tt>for the title and for much of the argument of <br>
this book comes from the work of Richard Stallman and the Free Soft-ware <br>
Foundation. Indeed, as I reread Stallman's own work, especially <br>
the essays in <i>Free Software, Free Society, </i>I realize that all of the theoret-ical <br>
insights I develop here are insights Stallman described decades <br>
ago. One could thus well argue that this work is "merely" derivative. <br>
I accept that criticism, if indeed it is a criticism. The work of a <br>
lawyer is always derivative, and I mean to do nothing more in this book <br>
than to remind a culture about a tradition that has always been its own. <br>
Like Stallman, I defend that tradition on the basis of values. Like <br>
Stallman, I believe those are the values of freedom. And like Stallman, <br>
I believe those are values of our past that will need to be defended in <br>
our future. A free culture has been our past, but it will only be our fu-ture <br>
if we change the path we are on right now. <br>

<br>

Like Stallman's arguments for free software, an argument for free <br>
culture stumbles on a confusion that is hard to avoid, and even harder <br>
to understand. A free culture is not a culture without property; it is not <br>
a culture in which artists don't get paid. A culture without property, or <br>
in which creators can't get paid, is anarchy, not freedom. Anarchy is not <br>
what I advance here. <br>
Instead, the free culture that I defend in this book is a balance be-tween <br>
anarchy and control. A free culture, like a free market, is filled <br>
with property. It is filled with rules of property and contract that get <br>
enforced by the state. But just as a free market is perverted if its prop-erty <br>
becomes feudal, so too can a free culture be queered by extremism <br>
in the property rights that define it. That is what I fear about our cul-ture <br>
today. It is against that extremism that this book is written. <br>

<tt>INTRODUCTION <br>
On December 17, 1903, </tt>on a windy North Carolina beach for just <br>
shy of one hundred seconds, the Wright brothers demonstrated that a <br>
heavier-than-air, self-propelled vehicle could fly. The moment was elec-tric <br>
and its importance widely understood. Almost immediately, there <br>
was an explosion of interest in this newfound technology of manned <br>
flight, and a gaggle of innovators began to build upon it. <br>
At the time the Wright brothers invented the airplane, American <br>
law held that a property owner presumptively owned not just the sur-face <br>
of his land, but all the land below, down to the center of the earth, <br>
and all the space above, to "an indefinite extent, upwards." 1 For many <br>
years, scholars had puzzled about how best to interpret the idea that <br>
rights in land ran to the heavens. Did that mean that you owned the <br>
stars? Could you prosecute geese for their willful and regular trespass? <br>
Then came airplanes, and for the first time, this principle of Amer-ican <br>
law&mdash;deep within the foundations of our tradition, and acknowl-edged <br>
by the most important legal thinkers of our past&mdash;mattered. If <br>
my land reaches to the heavens, what happens when United flies over <br>
my field? Do I have the right to banish it from my property? Am I al-1

</p><p>
lowed to enter into an exclusive license with Delta Airlines? Could we <br>
set up an auction to decide how much these rights are worth? <br>
In 1945, these questions became a federal case. When North Car-olina <br>
farmers Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby started losing chickens <br>
because of low-flying military aircraft (the terrified chickens appar-ently <br>
flew into the barn walls and died), the Causbys filed a lawsuit say-ing <br>
that the government was trespassing on their land. The airplanes, <br>
of course, never touched the surface of the Causbys' land. But if, as <br>
Blackstone, Kent, and Coke had said, their land reached to "an indefi-nite <br>
extent, upwards," then the government was trespassing on their <br>
property, and the Causbys wanted it to stop. <br>
The Supreme Court agreed to hear the Causbys' case. Congress had <br>
declared the airways public, but if one's property really extended to the <br>
heavens, then Congress's declaration could well have been an unconsti-tutional <br>
"taking" of property without compensation. The Court ac-knowledged <br>
that "it is ancient doctrine that common law ownership of <br>
the land extended to the periphery of the universe." But Justice Douglas <br>
had no patience for ancient doctrine. In a single paragraph, hundreds of <br>
years of property law were erased. As he wrote for the Court, <br>
</p><p>
[The] doctrine has no place in the modern world. The air is a <br>
public highway, as Congress has declared. Were that not true, <br>
every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to count-less <br>
trespass suits. Common sense revolts at the idea. To recognize <br>
such private claims to the airspace would clog these highways, se-riously <br>

conclusion that Douglas holds in a single line: "Common sense revolts <br>
at the idea." But whether it takes pages or a few words, it is the special <br>
genius of a common law system, as ours is, that the law adjusts to the <br>
technologies of the time. And as it adjusts, it changes. Ideas that were <br>
as solid as rock in one age crumble in another. <br>
Or at least, this is how things happen when there's no one powerful <br>
on the other side of the change. The Causbys were just farmers. And <br>
though there were no doubt many like them who were upset by the <br>
growing traffic in the air (though one hopes not many chickens flew <br>
themselves into walls), the Causbys of the world would find it very <br>
hard to unite and stop the idea, and the technology, that the Wright <br>
brothers had birthed. The Wright brothers spat airplanes into the <br>
technological meme pool; the idea then spread like a virus in a chicken <br>
coop; farmers like the Causbys found themselves surrounded by "what <br>
seemed reasonable" given the technology that the Wrights had pro-duced. <br>
They could stand on their farms, dead chickens in hand, and <br>
shake their fists at these newfangled technologies all they wanted. <br>
They could call their representatives or even file a lawsuit. But in the <br>
end, the force of what seems "obvious" to everyone else&mdash;the power of <br>
"common sense"&mdash;would prevail. Their "private interest" would not be <br>
allowed to defeat an obvious public gain. <br>

<tt>Edwin Howard Armstrong </tt>is one of America's forgotten inventor <br>
geniuses. He came to the great American inventor scene just after the <br>
titans Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. But his work in <br>
the area of radio technology was perhaps the most important of any <br>
single inventor in the first fifty years of radio. He was better educated <br>
than Michael Faraday, who as a bookbinder's apprentice had discov-ered <br>
electric induction in 1831. But he had the same intuition about <br>
how the world of radio worked, and on at least three occasions, Arm-strong <br>
invented profoundly important technologies that advanced our <br>
understanding of radio. <br>

</p><p>
On the day after Christmas, 1933, four patents were issued to Arm-strong <br>
for his most significant invention&mdash;FM radio. Until then, con-sumer <br>
radio had been amplitude-modulated (AM) radio. The theorists <br>
of the day had said that frequency-modulated (FM) radio could never <br>
work. They were right about FM radio in a narrow band of spectrum. <br>
But Armstrong discovered that frequency-modulated radio in a wide <br>
band of spectrum would deliver an astonishing fidelity of sound, with <br>
much less transmitter power and static. <br>
On November 5, 1935, he demonstrated the technology at a meet-ing <br>
of the Institute of Radio Engineers at the Empire State Building in <br>
New York City. He tuned his radio dial across a range of AM stations, <br>
until the radio locked on a broadcast that he had arranged from seven-teen <br>
miles away. The radio fell totally silent, as if dead, and then with a <br>
clarity no one else in that room had ever heard from an electrical de-vice, <br>
it produced the sound of an announcer's voice: "This is amateur <br>
station W2AG at Yonkers, New York, operating on frequency modu-lation <br>
at two and a half meters." <br>
The audience was hearing something no one had thought possible: <br>
</p><p>
A glass of water was poured before the microphone in Yonkers; it <br>
sounded like a glass of water being poured. ... A paper was <br>
crumpled and torn; it sounded like paper and not like a crackling <br>
forest fire. ... Sousa marches were played from records and a pi-ano <br>
solo and guitar number were performed. ... The music was <br>
projected with a live-ness rarely if ever heard before from a radio <br>
"music box." 3 <br>
</p><p>
As our own common sense tells us, Armstrong had discovered a <br>
vastly superior radio technology. But at the time of his invention, Arm-strong <br>
was working for RCA. RCA was the dominant player in the <br>
then dominant AM radio market. By 1935, there were a thousand radio <br>
stations across the United States, but the stations in large cities were all <br>
owned by a handful of networks. <br>

RCA's president, David Sarnoff, a friend of Armstrong's, was eager <br>
that Armstrong discover a way to remove static from AM radio. So <br>
Sarnoff was quite excited when Armstrong told him he had a device <br>
that removed static from "radio." But when Armstrong demonstrated <br>
his invention, Sarnoff was not pleased. <br>
</p><p>
I thought Armstrong would invent some kind of a filter to remove <br>
static from our AM radio. I didn't think he'd start a revolution&mdash;<br>
start up a whole damn new industry to compete with RCA. 4 <br>
</p><p>
Armstrong's invention threatened RCA's AM empire, so the com-pany <br>
launched a campaign to smother FM radio. While FM may have <br>
been a superior technology, Sarnoff was a superior tactician. As one au-thor <br>
described, <br>
</p><p>
The forces for FM, largely engineering, could not overcome the <br>
weight of strategy devised by the sales, patent, and legal offices <br>
to subdue this threat to corporate position. For FM, if allowed to <br>
develop unrestrained, posed ... a complete reordering of radio <br>
power . . . and the eventual overthrow of the carefully restricted <br>
AM system on which RCA had grown to power. 5 <br>
</p><p>
RCA at first kept the technology in house, insisting that further <br>
tests were needed. When, after two years of testing, Armstrong grew <br>
impatient, RCA began to use its power with the government to stall <br>
FM radio's deployment generally. In 1936, RCA hired the former head <br>
of the FCC and assigned him the task of assuring that the FCC assign <br>
spectrum in a way that would castrate FM&mdash;principally by moving FM <br>
radio to a different band of spectrum. At first, these efforts failed. But <br>
when Armstrong and the nation were distracted by World War II, <br>
RCA's work began to be more successful. Soon after the war ended, the <br>
FCC announced a set of policies that would have one clear effect: FM <br>
radio would be crippled. As Lawrence Lessing described it, <br>

<br>
</p><p>
The series of body blows that FM radio received right after the <br>
war, in a series of rulings manipulated through the FCC by the <br>
big radio interests, were almost incredible in their force and devi-ousness. 6 <br>
</p><p>
To make room in the spectrum for RCA's latest gamble, television, <br>
FM radio users were to be moved to a totally new spectrum band. The <br>
power of FM radio stations was also cut, meaning FM could no longer <br>
be used to beam programs from one part of the country to another. <br>
(This change was strongly supported by AT&amp; T, because the loss of <br>
FM relaying stations would mean radio stations would have to buy <br>
wired links from AT&amp; T.) The spread of FM radio was thus choked, at <br>
least temporarily. <br>
Armstrong resisted RCA's efforts. In response, RCA resisted Arm-strong's <br>
patents. After incorporating FM technology into the emerging <br>
standard for television, RCA declared the patents invalid&mdash;baselessly, <br>
and almost fifteen years after they were issued. It thus refused to pay <br>
him royalties. For six years, Armstrong fought an expensive war of lit-igation <br>
to defend the patents. Finally, just as the patents expired, RCA <br>
offered a settlement so low that it would not even cover Armstrong's <br>
lawyers' fees. Defeated, broken, and now broke, in 1954 Armstrong <br>
wrote a short note to his wife and then stepped out of a thirteenth-story <br>
window to his death. <br>
This is how the law sometimes works. Not often this tragically, and <br>
rarely with heroic drama, but sometimes, this is how it works. From the <br>
beginning, government and government agencies have been subject <br>
to capture. They are more likely captured when a powerful interest is <br>
threatened by either a legal or technical change. That powerful interest <br>
too often exerts its influence within the government to get the govern-ment <br>
to protect it. The rhetoric of this protection is of course always <br>
public spirited; the reality is something different. Ideas that were as <br>
solid as rock in one age, but that, left to themselves, would crumble in <br>

another, are sustained through this subtle corruption of our political <br>
process. RCA had what the Causbys did not: the power to stifle the ef-fect <br>
of technological change. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>There's no </tt>single inventor of the Internet. Nor is there any good <br>
date upon which to mark its birth. Yet in a very short time, the Inter-net <br>
has become part of ordinary American life. According to the Pew <br>
Internet and American Life Project, 58 percent of Americans had ac-cess <br>
to the Internet in 2002, up from 49 percent two years before. 7 <br>
That number could well exceed two thirds of the nation by the end <br>
of 2004. <br>
As the Internet has been integrated into ordinary life, it has <br>
changed things. Some of these changes are technical&mdash;the Internet has <br>
made communication faster, it has lowered the cost of gathering data, <br>
and so on. These technical changes are not the focus of this book. They <br>
are important. They are not well understood. But they are the sort of <br>
thing that would simply go away if we all just switched the Internet off. <br>
They don't affect people who don't use the Internet, or at least they <br>
don't affect them directly. They are the proper subject of a book about <br>
the Internet. But this is not a book about the Internet. <br>
Instead, this book is about an effect of the Internet beyond the In-ternet <br>
itself: an effect upon how culture is made. My claim is that the <br>
Internet has induced an important and unrecognized change in that <br>
process. That change will radically transform a tradition that is as old as <br>
the Republic itself. Most, if they recognized this change, would reject <br>
it. Yet most don't even see the change that the Internet has introduced. <br>
We can glimpse a sense of this change by distinguishing between <br>
commercial and noncommercial culture, and by mapping the law's reg-ulation <br>
of each. By "commercial culture" I mean that part of our culture <br>
that is produced and sold or produced to be sold. By "noncommercial <br>
culture" I mean all the rest. When old men sat around parks or on <br>

</p><p>
street corners telling stories that kids and others consumed, that was <br>
noncommercial culture. When Noah Webster published his "Reader," <br>
or Joel Barlow his poetry, that was commercial culture. <br>
At the beginning of our history, and for just about the whole of our <br>
tradition, noncommercial culture was essentially unregulated. Of <br>
course, if your stories were lewd, or if your song disturbed the peace, <br>
then the law might intervene. But the law was never directly concerned <br>
with the creation or spread of this form of culture, and it left this cul-ture <br>
"free." The ordinary ways in which ordinary individuals shared and <br>
transformed their culture&mdash;telling stories, reenacting scenes from plays <br>
or TV, participating in fan clubs, sharing music, making tapes&mdash;were <br>
left alone by the law. <br>
The focus of the law was on commercial creativity. At first slightly, <br>
then quite extensively, the law protected the incentives of creators by <br>
granting them exclusive rights to their creative work, so that they could <br>
sell those exclusive rights in a commercial marketplace. 8 This is also, of <br>
course, an important part of creativity and culture, and it has become <br>
an increasingly important part in America. But in no sense was it dom-inant <br>
within our tradition. It was instead just one part, a controlled <br>
part, balanced with the free. <br>
This rough divide between the free and the controlled has now <br>
been erased. 9 The Internet has set the stage for this erasure and, <br>
pushed by big media, the law has now affected it. For the first time in <br>
our tradition, the ordinary ways in which individuals create and share <br>
culture fall within the reach of the regulation of the law, which has ex-panded <br>
to draw within its control a vast amount of culture and crea-tivity <br>
that it never reached before. The technology that preserved the <br>
balance of our history&mdash;between uses of our culture that were free and <br>
uses of our culture that were only upon permission&mdash;has been undone. <br>
The consequence is that we are less and less a free culture, more and <br>
more a permission culture. <br>
This change gets justified as necessary to protect commercial cre-8 <br>

ativity. And indeed, protectionism is precisely its motivation. But the <br>
protectionism that justifies the changes that I will describe below is not <br>
the limited and balanced sort that has defined the law in the past. This <br>
is not a protectionism to protect artists. It is instead a protectionism <br>
to protect certain forms of business. Corporations threatened by the <br>
potential of the Internet to change the way both commercial and <br>
noncommercial culture are made and shared have united to induce <br>
lawmakers to use the law to protect them. It is the story of RCA and <br>
Armstrong; it is the dream of the Causbys. <br>
For the Internet has unleashed an extraordinary possibility for many <br>
to participate in the process of building and cultivating a culture that <br>
reaches far beyond local boundaries. That power has changed the mar-ketplace <br>
for making and cultivating culture generally, and that change <br>
in turn threatens established content industries. The Internet is thus to <br>
the industries that built and distributed content in the twentieth cen-tury <br>
what FM radio was to AM radio, or what the truck was to the <br>
railroad industry of the nineteenth century: the beginning of the end, <br>
or at least a substantial transformation. Digital technologies, tied to the <br>
Internet, could produce a vastly more competitive and vibrant market <br>
for building and cultivating culture; that market could include a much <br>
wider and more diverse range of creators; those creators could produce <br>
and distribute a much more vibrant range of creativity; and depending <br>
upon a few important factors, those creators could earn more on average <br>
from this system than creators do today&mdash;all so long as the RCAs of our <br>
day don't use the law to protect themselves against this competition. <br>
Yet, as I argue in the pages that follow, that is precisely what is hap-pening <br>
in our culture today. These modern-day equivalents of the early <br>
twentieth-century radio or nineteenth-century railroads are using their <br>
power to get the law to protect them against this new, more efficient, <br>
more vibrant technology for building culture. They are succeeding in <br>
their plan to remake the Internet before the Internet remakes them. <br>
It doesn't seem this way to many. The battles over copyright and the <br>

Internet seem remote to most. To the few who follow them, they seem <br>
mainly about a much simpler brace of questions&mdash;whether "piracy" will <br>
be permitted, and whether "property" will be protected. The "war" that <br>
has been waged against the technologies of the Internet&mdash;what Mo-tion <br>
Picture Association of America (MPAA) president Jack Valenti <br>
calls his "own terrorist war" 10 &ndash;has been framed as a battle about the <br>
rule of law and respect for property. To know which side to take in this <br>
war, most think that we need only decide whether we're for property or <br>
against it. <br>
If those really were the choices, then I would be with Jack Valenti <br>
and the content industry. I, too, am a believer in property, and espe-cially <br>
in the importance of what Mr. Valenti nicely calls "creative prop-erty." <br>
I believe that "piracy" is wrong, and that the law, properly tuned, <br>
should punish "piracy," whether on or off the Internet. <br>
But those simple beliefs mask a much more fundamental question <br>
and a much more dramatic change. My fear is that unless we come to see <br>
this change, the war to rid the world of Internet "pirates" will also rid our <br>
culture of values that have been integral to our tradition from the start. <br>
These values built a tradition that, for at least the first 180 years of <br>
our Republic, guaranteed creators the right to build freely upon their <br>
past, and protected creators and innovators from either state or private <br>
control. The First Amendment protected creators against state control. <br>
And as Professor Neil Netanel powerfully argues, 11 copyright law, prop-erly <br>
balanced, protected creators against private control. Our tradition <br>
was thus neither Soviet nor the tradition of patrons. It instead carved out <br>
a wide berth within which creators could cultivate and extend our culture. <br>
Yet the law's response to the Internet, when tied to changes in the <br>
technology of the Internet itself, has massively increased the effective <br>
regulation of creativity in America. To build upon or critique the cul-ture <br>
around us one must ask, Oliver TwistÐ like, for permission first. <br>
Permission is, of course, often granted&mdash;but it is not often granted to <br>
the critical or the independent. We have built a kind of cultural nobil-10 <br>

ity; those within the noble class live easily; those outside it don't. But it <br>
is nobility of any form that is alien to our tradition. <br>
The story that follows is about this war. Is it not about the "central-ity <br>
of technology" to ordinary life. I don't believe in gods, digital or <br>
otherwise. Nor is it an effort to demonize any individual or group, for <br>
neither do I believe in a devil, corporate or otherwise. It is not a moral-ity <br>
tale. Nor is it a call to jihad against an industry. <br>
It is instead an effort to understand a hopelessly destructive war in-spired <br>
by the technologies of the Internet but reaching far beyond its <br>
code. And by understanding this battle, it is an effort to map peace. <br>
There is no good reason for the current struggle around Internet tech-nologies <br>
to continue. There will be great harm to our tradition and <br>
culture if it is allowed to continue unchecked. We must come to un-derstand <br>
the source of this war. We must resolve it soon. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Like the Causbys' </tt>battle, this war is, in part, about "property." <br>
The property of this war is not as tangible as the Causbys', and no <br>
innocent chicken has yet to lose its life. Yet the ideas surrounding this <br>
"property" are as obvious to most as the Causbys' claim about the sa-credness <br>
of their farm was to them. We are the Causbys. Most of us <br>
take for granted the extraordinarily powerful claims that the owners of <br>
"intellectual property" now assert. Most of us, like the Causbys, treat <br>
these claims as obvious. And hence we, like the Causbys, object when <br>
a new technology interferes with this property. It is as plain to us as it <br>
was to them that the new technologies of the Internet are "trespassing" <br>
upon legitimate claims of "property." It is as plain to us as it was to <br>
them that the law should intervene to stop this trespass. <br>
And thus, when geeks and technologists defend their Armstrong or <br>
Wright brothers technology, most of us are simply unsympathetic. Com-mon <br>
sense does not revolt. Unlike in the case of the unlucky Causbys, <br>
common sense is on the side of the property owners in this war. Unlike <br>

the lucky Wright brothers, the Internet has not inspired a revolution <br>
on its side. <br>
My hope is to push this common sense along. I have become in-creasingly <br>
amazed by the power of this idea of intellectual property <br>
and, more importantly, its power to disable critical thought by policy <br>
makers and citizens. There has never been a time in our history when <br>
more of our "culture" was as "owned" as it is now. And yet there has <br>
never been a time when the concentration of power to control the <i>uses <br>
</i>of culture has been as unquestioningly accepted as it is now. <br>
The puzzle is, Why? <br>
Is it because we have come to understand a truth about the value <br>
and importance of absolute property over ideas and culture? Is it be-cause <br>
we have discovered that our tradition of rejecting such an ab-solute <br>
claim was wrong? <br>
Or is it because the idea of absolute property over ideas and culture <br>
benefits the RCAs of our time and fits our own unreflective intuitions? <br>
Is the radical shift away from our tradition of free culture an instance <br>
of America correcting a mistake from its past, as we did after a bloody <br>
war with slavery, and as we are slowly doing with inequality? Or is the <br>
radical shift away from our tradition of free culture yet another example <br>
of a political system captured by a few powerful special interests? <br>
Does common sense lead to the extremes on this question because <br>
common sense actually believes in these extremes? Or does common <br>
sense stand silent in the face of these extremes because, as with Arm-strong <br>
versus RCA, the more powerful side has ensured that it has the <br>
more powerful view? <br>
I don't mean to be mysterious. My own views are resolved. I believe <br>
it was right for common sense to revolt against the extremism of the <br>
Causbys. I believe it would be right for common sense to revolt against <br>
the extreme claims made today on behalf of "intellectual property." <br>
What the law demands today is increasingly as silly as a sheriff arrest-ing <br>
an airplane for trespass. But the consequences of this silliness will <br>
be much more profound. <br>

<tt>The struggle </tt>that rages just now centers on two ideas: "piracy" and <br>
"property." My aim in this book's next two parts is to explore these two <br>
ideas. <br>
My method is not the usual method of an academic. I don't want to <br>
plunge you into a complex argument, buttressed with references to ob-scure <br>
French theorists&mdash;however natural that is for the weird sort we <br>
academics have become. Instead I begin in each part with a collection <br>
of stories that set a context within which these apparently simple ideas <br>
can be more fully understood. <br>
The two sections set up the core claim of this book: that while the <br>
Internet has indeed produced something fantastic and new, our gov-ernment, <br>
pushed by big media to respond to this "something new," is <br>
destroying something very old. Rather than understanding the changes <br>
the Internet might permit, and rather than taking time to let "common <br>
sense" resolve how best to respond, we are allowing those most threat-ened <br>
by the changes to use their power to change the law&mdash;and more <br>
importantly, to use their power to change something fundamental about <br>
who we have always been. <br>
We allow this, I believe, not because it is right, and not because <br>
most of us really believe in these changes. We allow it because the in-terests <br>
most threatened are among the most powerful players in our <br>
depressingly compromised process of making law. This book is the <br>
story of one more consequence of this form of corruption&mdash;a conse-quence <br>
to which most of us remain oblivious. <br>

<tt>Since the inception </tt>of the law regulating creative property, there <br>
has been a war against "piracy." The precise contours of this concept, <br>
"piracy," are hard to sketch, but the animating injustice is easy to cap-ture. <br>
As Lord Mansfield wrote in a case that extended the reach of <br>
English copyright law to include sheet music, <br>
</p><p>
A person may use the copy by playing it, but he has no right to <br>
rob the author of the profit, by multiplying copies and disposing <br>
of them for his own use. 1 <br>

Today we are in the middle of another "war" against "piracy." The <br>
Internet has provoked this war. The Internet makes possible the effi-cient <br>
spread of content. Peer-to-peer (p2p) file sharing is among the <br>
most efficient of the efficient technologies the Internet enables. Using <br>
distributed intelligence, p2p systems facilitate the easy spread of con-tent <br>
in a way unimagined a generation ago. <br>

<br>
</p><p>
This efficiency does not respect the traditional lines of copyright. <br>
The network doesn't discriminate between the sharing of copyrighted <br>
and uncopyrighted content. Thus has there been a vast amount of shar-ing <br>
of copyrighted content. That sharing in turn has excited the war, as <br>
copyright owners fear the sharing will "rob the author of the profit." <br>
The warriors have turned to the courts, to the legislatures, and in-creasingly <br>
to technology to defend their "property" against this "piracy." <br>
A generation of Americans, the warriors warn, is being raised to be-lieve <br>
that "property" should be "free." Forget tattoos, never mind body <br>
piercing&mdash;our kids are becoming <i>thieves! <br>
</i>There's no doubt that "piracy" is wrong, and that pirates should be <br>
punished. But before we summon the executioners, we should put this <br>
notion of "piracy" in some context. For as the concept is increasingly <br>
used, at its core is an extraordinary idea that is almost certainly wrong. <br>
The idea goes something like this: <br>
</p><p>
Creative work has value; whenever I use, or take, or build upon <br>
the creative work of others, I am taking from them something of <br>
value. Whenever I take something of value from someone else, I <br>
should have their permission. The taking of something of value <br>
from someone else without permission is wrong. It is a form of <br>
piracy. <br>
</p><p>
This view runs deep within the current debates. It is what NYU law <br>
professor Rochelle Dreyfuss criticizes as the "if value, then right" the-ory <br>
of creative property 2 &ndash;if there is value, then someone must have a <br>
right to that value. It is the perspective that led a composers' rights or-ganization, <br>
ASCAP, to sue the Girl Scouts for failing to pay for the <br>
songs that girls sang around Girl Scout campfires. 3 There was "value" <br>
(the songs) so there must have been a "right"&mdash;even against the Girl <br>
Scouts. <br>
This idea is certainly a possible understanding of how creative <br>
property should work. It might well be a possible design for a system <br>

of law protecting creative property. But the "if value, then right" theory <br>
of creative property has never been America's theory of creative prop-erty. <br>
It has never taken hold within our law. <br>
Instead, in our tradition, intellectual property is an instrument. It <br>
sets the groundwork for a richly creative society but remains sub-servient <br>
to the value of creativity. The current debate has this turned <br>
around. We have become so concerned with protecting the instrument <br>
that we are losing sight of the value. <br>
The source of this confusion is a distinction that the law no longer <br>
takes care to draw&mdash;the distinction between republishing someone's <br>
work on the one hand and building upon or transforming that work on <br>
the other. Copyright law at its birth had only publishing as its concern; <br>
copyright law today regulates both. <br>
Before the technologies of the Internet, this conflation didn't mat-ter <br>
all that much. The technologies of publishing were expensive; that <br>
meant the vast majority of publishing was commercial. Commercial <br>
entities could bear the burden of the law&mdash;even the burden of the <br>
Byzantine complexity that copyright law has become. It was just one <br>
more expense of doing business. <br>
But with the birth of the Internet, this natural limit to the reach of <br>
the law has disappeared. The law controls not just the creativity of <br>
commercial creators but effectively that of anyone. Although that ex-pansion <br>
would not matter much if copyright law regulated only "copy-ing," <br>
when the law regulates as broadly and obscurely as it does, the <br>
extension matters a lot. The burden of this law now vastly outweighs <br>
any original benefit&mdash;certainly as it affects noncommercial creativity, <br>
and increasingly as it affects commercial creativity as well. Thus, as <br>
we'll see more clearly in the chapters below, the law's role is less and <br>
less to support creativity, and more and more to protect certain indus-tries <br>
against competition. Just at the time digital technology could <br>
unleash an extraordinary range of commercial and noncommercial <br>
creativity, the law burdens this creativity with insanely complex and <br>
vague rules and with the threat of obscenely severe penalties. We may <br>

be seeing, as Richard Florida writes, the "Rise of the Creative Class." 4 <br>
Unfortunately, we are also seeing an extraordinary rise of regulation of <br>
this creative class. <br>
These burdens make no sense in our tradition. We should begin by <br>
understanding that tradition a bit more and by placing in their proper <br>
context the current battles about behavior labeled "piracy." <br>

<tt>CHAPTER ONE: Creators <br>
In 1928, </tt>a cartoon character was born. An early Mickey Mouse <br>
made his debut in May of that year, in a silent flop called <i>Plane Crazy. <br>
</i>In November, in New York City's Colony Theater, in the first widely <br>
distributed cartoon synchronized with sound, <i>Steamboat Willie </i>brought <br>
to life the character that would become Mickey Mouse. <br>
Synchronized sound had been introduced to film a year earlier in <br>
the movie <i>The Jazz Singer. </i>That success led Walt Disney to copy the <br>
technique and mix sound with cartoons. No one knew whether it <br>
would work or, if it did work, whether it would win an audience. But <br>
when Disney ran a test in the summer of 1928, the results were unam-biguous. <br>
As Disney describes that first experiment, <br>
</p><p>
A couple of my boys could read music, and one of them could play <br>
a mouth organ. We put them in a room where they could not see <br>
the screen and arranged to pipe their sound into the room where <br>
our wives and friends were going to see the picture. <br>
</p><p>

<a href="#page37">37</a>
<br>
</p><p>
The boys worked from a music and sound-effects score. After <br>
several false starts, sound and action got off with the gun. The <br>
mouth organist played the tune, the rest of us in the sound de-partment <br>
bammed tin pans and blew slide whistles on the beat. <br>
The synchronization was pretty close. <br>
The effect on our little audience was nothing less than elec-tric. <br>
They responded almost instinctively to this union of sound <br>
and motion. I thought they were kidding me. So they put me in <br>
the audience and ran the action again. It was terrible, but it was <br>
wonderful! And it was something new! 1 <br>
</p><p>
Disney's then partner, and one of animation's most extraordinary <br>
talents, Ub Iwerks, put it more strongly: "I have never been so thrilled <br>
in my life. Nothing since has ever equaled it." <br>
Disney had created something very new, based upon something rel-atively <br>
new. Synchronized sound brought life to a form of creativity <br>
that had rarely&mdash;except in Disney's hands&mdash;been anything more than <br>
filler for other films. Throughout animation's early history, it was Dis-ney's <br>
invention that set the standard that others struggled to match. <br>
And quite often, Disney's great genius, his spark of creativity, was built <br>
upon the work of others. <br>
This much is familiar. What you might not know is that 1928 also <br>
marks another important transition. In that year, a comic (as opposed <br>
to cartoon) genius created his last independently produced silent film. <br>
That genius was Buster Keaton. The film was <i>Steamboat Bill, Jr. <br>
</i>Keaton was born into a vaudeville family in 1895. In the era of <br>
silent film, he had mastered using broad physical comedy as a way to <br>
spark uncontrollable laughter from his audience. <i>Steamboat Bill, Jr. </i>was <br>
a classic of this form, famous among film buffs for its incredible stunts. <br>
The film was classic Keaton&mdash;wildly popular and among the best of its <br>
genre. <br>
<i>Steamboat Bill, Jr. </i>appeared before Disney's cartoon <i>Steamboat Willie. <br>
</i>The coincidence of titles is not coincidental. Steamboat Willie is a di-22 <br>

rect cartoon parody of Steamboat Bill, 2 and both are built upon a com-mon <br>
song as a source. It is not just from the invention of synchronized <br>
sound in <i>The Jazz Singer </i>that we get <i>Steamboat Willie. </i>It is also from <br>
Buster Keaton's invention of Steamboat Bill, Jr., itself inspired by the <br>
song "Steamboat Bill," that we get Steamboat Willie, and then from <br>
Steamboat Willie, Mickey Mouse. <br>
This "borrowing" was nothing unique, either for Disney or for the <br>
industry. Disney was always parroting the feature-length mainstream <br>
films of his day. 3 So did many others. Early cartoons are filled with <br>
knockoffs&mdash;slight variations on winning themes; retellings of ancient <br>
stories. The key to success was the brilliance of the differences. With <br>
Disney, it was sound that gave his animation its spark. Later, it was the <br>
quality of his work relative to the production-line cartoons with which <br>
he competed. Yet these additions were built upon a base that was bor-rowed. <br>
Disney added to the work of others before him, creating some-thing <br>
new out of something just barely old. <br>
Sometimes this borrowing was slight. Sometimes it was significant. <br>
Think about the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm. If you're as oblivi-ous <br>
as I was, you're likely to think that these tales are happy, sweet sto-ries, <br>
appropriate for any child at bedtime. In fact, the Grimm fairy tales <br>
are, well, for us, grim. It is a rare and perhaps overly ambitious parent <br>
who would dare to read these bloody, moralistic stories to his or her <br>
child, at bedtime or anytime. <br>
Disney took these stories and retold them in a way that carried <br>
them into a new age. He animated the stories, with both characters and <br>
light. Without removing the elements of fear and danger altogether, he <br>
made funny what was dark and injected a genuine emotion of compas-sion <br>
where before there was fear. And not just with the work of the <br>
Brothers Grimm. Indeed, the catalog of Disney work drawing upon <br>
the work of others is astonishing when set together: <i>Snow White <br>
</i>(1937), <i>Fantasia </i>(1940), <i>Pinocchio </i>(1940), <i>Dumbo </i>(1941), <i>Bambi <br>
</i>(1942), <i>Song of the South </i>(1946), <i>Cinderella </i>(1950), <i>Alice in Wonderland <br>
</i>(1951), <i>Robin Hood </i>(1952), <i>Peter Pan </i>(1953), <i>Lady and the Tramp <br>

(1955), <i>Mulan </i>(1998), <i>Sleeping Beauty </i>(1959), <i>101 Dalmatians </i>(1961), <br>
<i>The Sword in the Stone </i>(1963), and <i>The Jungle Book </i>(1967)&mdash;not to <br>
mention a recent example that we should perhaps quickly forget, <i>Trea-sure <br>
Planet </i>(2003). In all of these cases, Disney (or Disney, Inc.) ripped <br>
creativity from the culture around him, mixed that creativity with his <br>
own extraordinary talent, and then burned that mix into the soul of his <br>
culture. Rip, mix, and burn. <br>
This is a kind of creativity. It is a creativity that we should remem-ber <br>
and celebrate. There are some who would say that there is no cre-ativity <br>
except this kind. We don't need to go that far to recognize its <br>
importance. We could call this "Disney creativity," though that would <br>
be a bit misleading. It is, more precisely, "Walt Disney creativity"&mdash;a <br>
form of expression and genius that builds upon the culture around us <br>
and makes it something different. <br>
In 1928, the culture that Disney was free to draw upon was rela-tively <br>
fresh. The public domain in 1928 was not very old and was <br>
therefore quite vibrant. The average term of copyright was just around <br>
thirty years&mdash;for that minority of creative work that was in fact copy-righted. 4 <br>
That means that for thirty years, on average, the authors or <br>
copyright holders of a creative work had an "exclusive right" to control <br>
certain uses of the work. To use this copyrighted work in limited ways <br>
required the permission of the copyright owner. <br>
At the end of a copyright term, a work passes into the public do-main. <br>
No permission is then needed to draw upon or use that work. No <br>
permission and, hence, no lawyers. The public domain is a "lawyer-free <br>
zone." Thus, most of the content from the nineteenth century was free <br>
for Disney to use and build upon in 1928. It was free for anyone&mdash;<br>
whether connected or not, whether rich or not, whether approved or <br>
not&mdash;to use and build upon. <br>
This is the ways things always were&mdash;until quite recently. For most <br>
of our history, the public domain was just over the horizon. From 1790 <br>
until 1978, the average copyright term was never more than thirty-two <br>
years, meaning that most culture just a generation and a half old was <br>

free for anyone to build upon without the permission of anyone else. <br>
Today's equivalent would be for creative work from the 1960s and <br>
1970s to now be free for the next Walt Disney to build upon without <br>
permission. Yet today, the public domain is presumptive only for con-tent <br>
from before the Great Depression. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Of course, </tt>Walt Disney had no monopoly on "Walt Disney cre-ativity." <br>
Nor does America. The norm of free culture has, until recently, <br>
and except within totalitarian nations, been broadly exploited and quite <br>
universal. <br>
Consider, for example, a form of creativity that seems strange to <br>
many Americans but that is inescapable within Japanese culture: <br>
<i>manga, </i>or comics. The Japanese are fanatics about comics. Some 40 <br>
percent of publications are comics, and 30 percent of publication rev-enue <br>
derives from comics. They are everywhere in Japanese society, at <br>
every magazine stand, carried by a large proportion of commuters on <br>
Japan's extraordinary system of public transportation. <br>
Americans tend to look down upon this form of culture. That's an <br>
unattractive characteristic of ours. We're likely to misunderstand much <br>
about manga, because few of us have ever read anything close to the <br>
stories that these "graphic novels" tell. For the Japanese, manga cover <br>
every aspect of social life. For us, comics are "men in tights." And any-way, <br>
it's not as if the New York subways are filled with readers of Joyce <br>
or even Hemingway. People of different cultures distract themselves in <br>
different ways, the Japanese in this interestingly different way. <br>
But my purpose here is not to understand manga. It is to describe a <br>
variant on manga that from a lawyer's perspective is quite odd, but <br>
from a Disney perspective is quite familiar. <br>
This is the phenomenon of <i>doujinshi. </i>Doujinshi are also comics, but <br>
they are a kind of copycat comic. A rich ethic governs the creation of <br>
doujinshi. It is not doujinshi if it is <i>just </i>a copy; the artist must make a <br>
contribution to the art he copies, by transforming it either subtly or <br>

<br>
</p><p>
significantly. A doujinshi comic can thus take a mainstream comic and <br>
develop it differently&mdash;with a different story line. Or the comic can <br>
keep the character in character but change its look slightly. There is no <br>
formula for what makes the doujinshi sufficiently "different." But they <br>
must be different if they are to be considered true doujinshi. Indeed, <br>
there are committees that review doujinshi for inclusion within shows <br>
and reject any copycat comic that is merely a copy. <br>
These copycat comics are not a tiny part of the manga market. They <br>
are huge. More than 33,000 "circles" of creators from across Japan pro-duce <br>
these bits of Walt Disney creativity. More than 450,000 Japanese <br>
come together twice a year, in the largest public gathering in the coun-try, <br>
to exchange and sell them. This market exists in parallel to the <br>
mainstream commercial manga market. In some ways, it obviously <br>
competes with that market, but there is no sustained effort by those <br>
who control the commercial manga market to shut the doujinshi mar-ket <br>
down. It flourishes, despite the competition and despite the law. <br>
The most puzzling feature of the doujinshi market, for those <br>
trained in the law, at least, is that it is allowed to exist at all. Under <br>
Japanese copyright law, which in this respect (on paper) mirrors Amer-ican <br>
copyright law, the doujinshi market is an illegal one. Doujinshi are <br>
plainly "derivative works." There is no general practice by doujinshi <br>
artists of securing the permission of the manga creators. Instead, the <br>
practice is simply to take and modify the creations of others, as Walt <br>
Disney did with <i>Steamboat Bill, Jr. </i>Under both Japanese and American <br>
law, that "taking" without the permission of the original copyright <br>
owner is illegal. It is an infringement of the original copyright to make <br>
a copy or a derivative work without the original copyright owner's <br>
permission. <br>
Yet this illegal market exists and indeed flourishes in Japan, and in <br>
the view of many, it is precisely because it exists that Japanese manga <br>
flourish. As American graphic novelist Judd Winick said to me, "The <br>
early days of comics in America are very much like what's going on <br>
in Japan now.... American comics were born out of copying each <br>

<br>

other.... That's how [the artists] learn to draw&mdash;by going into comic <br>
books and not tracing them, but looking at them and copying them" <br>
and building from them. 5 <br>
American comics now are quite different, Winick explains, in part <br>
because of the legal difficulty of adapting comics the way doujinshi are <br>
allowed. Speaking of Superman, Winick told me, "there are these rules <br>
and you have to stick to them." There are things Superman "cannot" <br>
do. "As a creator, it's frustrating having to stick to some parameters <br>
which are fifty years old." <br>
The norm in Japan mitigates this legal difficulty. Some say it is pre-cisely <br>
the benefit accruing to the Japanese manga market that explains <br>
the mitigation. Temple University law professor Salil Mehra, for ex-ample, <br>
hypothesizes that the manga market accepts these technical <br>
violations because they spur the manga market to be more wealthy and <br>
productive. Everyone would be worse off if doujinshi were banned, so <br>
the law does not ban doujinshi. 6 <br>
The problem with this story, however, as Mehra plainly acknowl-edges, <br>
is that the mechanism producing this laissez faire response is not <br>
clear. It may well be that the market as a whole is better off if doujin-shi <br>
are permitted rather than banned, but that doesn't explain why in-dividual <br>
copyright owners don't sue nonetheless. If the law has no <br>
general exception for doujinshi, and indeed in some cases individual <br>
manga artists have sued doujinshi artists, why is there not a more gen-eral <br>
pattern of blocking this "free taking" by the doujinshi culture? <br>
I spent four wonderful months in Japan, and I asked this question <br>
as often as I could. Perhaps the best account in the end was offered by <br>
a friend from a major Japanese law firm. "We don't have enough <br>
lawyers," he told me one afternoon. There "just aren't enough resources <br>
to prosecute cases like this." <br>
This is a theme to which we will return: that regulation by law is a <br>
function of both the words on the books and the costs of making those <br>
words have effect. For now, focus on the obvious question that is <br>
begged: Would Japan be better off with more lawyers? Would manga <br>

be richer if doujinshi artists were regularly prosecuted? Would the <br>
Japanese gain something important if they could end this practice of <br>
uncompensated sharing? Does piracy here hurt the victims of the <br>
piracy, or does it help them? Would lawyers fighting this piracy help <br>
their clients or hurt them? <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Let's pause </tt>for a moment. <br>
If you're like I was a decade ago, or like most people are when they <br>
first start thinking about these issues, then just about now you should <br>
be puzzled about something you hadn't thought through before. <br>
We live in a world that celebrates "property." I am one of those cel-ebrants. <br>
I believe in the value of property in general, and I also believe <br>
in the value of that weird form of property that lawyers call "intellec-tual <br>
property." 7 A large, diverse society cannot survive without prop-erty; <br>
a large, diverse, and modern society cannot flourish without <br>
intellectual property. <br>
But it takes just a second's reflection to realize that there is plenty of <br>
value out there that "property" doesn't capture. I don't mean "money <br>
can't buy you love," but rather, value that is plainly part of a process of <br>
production, including commercial as well as noncommercial produc-tion. <br>
If Disney animators had stolen a set of pencils to draw Steamboat <br>
Willie, we'd have no hesitation in condemning that taking as wrong&mdash;<br>
even though trivial, even if unnoticed. Yet there was nothing wrong, at <br>
least under the law of the day, with Disney's taking from Buster Keaton <br>
or from the Brothers Grimm. There was nothing wrong with the tak-ing <br>
from Keaton because Disney's use would have been considered <br>
"fair." There was nothing wrong with the taking from the Grimms be-cause <br>
the Grimms' work was in the public domain. <br>
Thus, even though the things that Disney took&mdash;or more generally, <br>
the things taken by anyone exercising Walt Disney creativity&mdash;are <br>
valuable, our tradition does not treat those takings as wrong. Some <br>

<br>

things remain free for the taking within a free culture, and that free-dom <br>
is good. <br>
The same with the doujinshi culture. If a doujinshi artist broke into <br>
a publisher's office and ran off with a thousand copies of his latest <br>
work&mdash;or even one copy&mdash;without paying, we'd have no hesitation in <br>
saying the artist was wrong. In addition to having trespassed, he would <br>
have stolen something of value. The law bans that stealing in whatever <br>
form, whether large or small. <br>
Yet there is an obvious reluctance, even among Japanese lawyers, to <br>
say that the copycat comic artists are "stealing." This form of Walt Dis-ney <br>
creativity is seen as fair and right, even if lawyers in particular find <br>
it hard to say why. <br>
It's the same with a thousand examples that appear everywhere once <br>
you begin to look. Scientists build upon the work of other scientists <br>
without asking or paying for the privilege. (" Excuse me, Professor Ein-stein, <br>
but may I have permission to use your theory of relativity to show <br>
that you were wrong about quantum physics?") Acting companies per-form <br>
adaptations of the works of Shakespeare without securing per-mission <br>
from anyone. (Does <i>anyone </i>believe Shakespeare would be <br>
better spread within our culture if there were a central Shakespeare <br>
rights clearinghouse that all productions of Shakespeare must appeal <br>
to first?) And Hollywood goes through cycles with a certain kind of <br>
movie: five asteroid films in the late 1990s; two volcano disaster films <br>
in 1997. <br>
Creators here and everywhere are always and at all times building <br>
upon the creativity that went before and that surrounds them now. <br>
That building is always and everywhere at least partially done without <br>
permission and without compensating the original creator. No society, <br>

The hard question is therefore not <i>whether </i>a culture is free. All cul-tures <br>
are free to some degree. The hard question instead is "How free is <br>
this culture?" How much, and how broadly, is the culture free for oth-ers <br>
to take and build upon? Is that freedom limited to party members? <br>
To members of the royal family? To the top ten corporations on the <br>
New York Stock Exchange? Or is that freedom spread broadly? To <br>
artists generally, whether affiliated with the Met or not? To musicians <br>
generally, whether white or not? To filmmakers generally, whether af-filiated <br>
with a studio or not? <br>
Free cultures are cultures that leave a great deal open for others to <br>
build upon; unfree, or permission, cultures leave much less. Ours was a <br>
free culture. It is becoming much less so. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER TWO: "Mere Copyists" <br>
In 1839, </tt>Louis Daguerre invented the first practical technology for <br>
producing what we would call "photographs." Appropriately enough, <br>
they were called "daguerreotypes." The process was complicated and <br>
expensive, and the field was thus limited to professionals and a few <br>
zealous and wealthy amateurs. (There was even an American Daguerre <br>
Association that helped regulate the industry, as do all such associa-tions, <br>
by keeping competition down so as to keep prices up.) <br>
Yet despite high prices, the demand for daguerreotypes was strong. <br>
This pushed inventors to find simpler and cheaper ways to make "au-tomatic <br>
pictures." William Talbot soon discovered a process for mak-ing <br>
"negatives." But because the negatives were glass, and had to be <br>
kept wet, the process still remained expensive and cumbersome. In the <br>
1870s, dry plates were developed, making it easier to separate the tak-ing <br>
of a picture from its developing. These were still plates of glass, and <br>
thus it was still not a process within reach of most amateurs. <br>
The technological change that made mass photography possible <br>
didn't happen until 1888, and was the creation of a single man. George <br>

<br>
</p><p>
Eastman, himself an amateur photographer, was frustrated by the <br>
technology of photographs made with plates. In a flash of insight (so <br>
to speak), Eastman saw that if the film could be made to be flexible, it <br>
could be held on a single spindle. That roll could then be sent to a de-veloper, <br>
driving the costs of photography down substantially. By lower-ing <br>
the costs, Eastman expected he could dramatically broaden the <br>
population of photographers. <br>
Eastman developed flexible, emulsion-coated paper film and placed <br>
rolls of it in small, simple cameras: the Kodak. The device was mar-keted <br>
on the basis of its simplicity. "You press the button and we do the <br>
rest." 1 As he described in <i>The Kodak Primer: <br>
</i></p><p>
The principle of the Kodak system is the separation of the work <br>
that any person whomsoever can do in making a photograph, <br>
from the work that only an expert can do.... We furnish any-body, <br>
man, woman or child, who has sufficient intelligence to <br>
point a box straight and press a button, with an instrument which <br>
altogether removes from the practice of photography the neces-sity <br>
for exceptional facilities or, in fact, any special knowledge of <br>
the art. It can be employed without preliminary study, without a <br>
darkroom and without chemicals. 2 <br>
</p><p>
For $25, anyone could make pictures. The camera came preloaded <br>
with film, and when it had been used, the camera was returned to an <br>
Eastman factory, where the film was developed. Over time, of course, <br>
the cost of the camera and the ease with which it could be used both <br>
improved. Roll film thus became the basis for the explosive growth of <br>
popular photography. Eastman's camera first went on sale in 1888; one <br>
year later, Kodak was printing more than six thousand negatives a day. <br>
From 1888 through 1909, while industrial production was rising by 4.7 <br>
percent, photographic equipment and material sales increased by 11 <br>
percent. 3 Eastman Kodak's sales during the same period experienced <br>
an average annual increase of over 17 percent. 4 <br>

<br>

The real significance of Eastman's invention, however, was not <br>
economic. It was social. Professional photography gave individuals a <br>
glimpse of places they would never otherwise see. Amateur photogra-phy <br>
gave them the ability to record their own lives in a way they had <br>
never been able to do before. As author Brian Coe notes, "For the first <br>
time the snapshot album provided the man on the street with a per-manent <br>
record of his family and its activities. ... For the first time in <br>
history there exists an authentic visual record of the appearance and ac-tivities <br>
of the common man made without [literary] interpretation <br>
or bias." 5 <br>
In this way, the Kodak camera and film were technologies of ex-pression. <br>
The pencil or paintbrush was also a technology of expression, <br>
of course. But it took years of training before they could be deployed by <br>
amateurs in any useful or effective way. With the Kodak, expression <br>
was possible much sooner and more simply. The barrier to expression <br>
was lowered. Snobs would sneer at its "quality"; professionals would <br>
discount it as irrelevant. But watch a child study how best to frame a <br>
picture and you get a sense of the experience of creativity that the Ko-dak <br>
enabled. Democratic tools gave ordinary people a way to express <br>
themselves more easily than any tools could have before. <br>
What was required for this technology to flourish? Obviously, <br>
Eastman's genius was an important part. But also important was the le-gal <br>
environment within which Eastman's invention grew. For early in <br>
the history of photography, there was a series of judicial decisions that <br>
could well have changed the course of photography substantially. <br>
Courts were asked whether the photographer, amateur or professional, <br>
required permission before he could capture and print whatever image <br>
he wanted. Their answer was no. 6 <br>
The arguments in favor of requiring permission will sound surpris-ingly <br>
familiar. The photographer was "taking" something from the per-son <br>
or building whose photograph he shot&mdash;pirating something of <br>
value. Some even thought he was taking the target's soul. Just as Dis-ney <br>
was not free to take the pencils that his animators used to draw <br>

<br>
</p><p>
Mickey, so, too, should these photographers not be free to take images <br>
that they thought valuable. <br>
On the other side was an argument that should be familiar, as well. <br>
Sure, there may be something of value being used. But citizens should <br>
have the right to capture at least those images that stand in public view. <br>
(Louis Brandeis, who would become a Supreme Court Justice, thought <br>
the rule should be different for images from private spaces. 7 ) It may be <br>
that this means that the photographer gets something for nothing. Just <br>
as Disney could take inspiration from <i>Steamboat Bill, Jr. </i>or the Broth-ers <br>
Grimm, the photographer should be free to capture an image with-out <br>
compensating the source. <br>
Fortunately for Mr. Eastman, and for photography in general, these <br>
early decisions went in favor of the pirates. In general, no permission <br>
would be required before an image could be captured and shared with <br>
others. Instead, permission was presumed. Freedom was the default. <br>
(The law would eventually craft an exception for famous people: com-mercial <br>
photographers who snap pictures of famous people for com-mercial <br>
purposes have more restrictions than the rest of us. But in the <br>
ordinary case, the image can be captured without clearing the rights to <br>
do the capturing. 8 ) <br>
We can only speculate about how photography would have devel-oped <br>
had the law gone the other way. If the presumption had been <br>
against the photographer, then the photographer would have had to <br>
demonstrate permission. Perhaps Eastman Kodak would have had to <br>
demonstrate permission, too, before it developed the film upon which <br>
images were captured. After all, if permission were not granted, then <br>
Eastman Kodak would be benefiting from the "theft" committed by <br>
the photographer. Just as Napster benefited from the copyright in-fringements <br>
committed by Napster users, Kodak would be benefiting <br>
from the "image-right" infringement of its photographers. We could <br>
imagine the law then requiring that some form of permission be <br>
demonstrated before a company developed pictures. We could imagine <br>
a system developing to demonstrate that permission. <br>

But though we could imagine this system of permission, it would <br>
be very hard to see how photography could have flourished as it did if <br>
the requirement for permission had been built into the rules that gov-ern <br>
it. Photography would have existed. It would have grown in im-portance <br>
over time. Professionals would have continued to use the <br>
technology as they did&mdash;since professionals could have more easily borne <br>
the burdens of the permission system. But the spread of photography <br>
to ordinary people would not have occurred. Nothing like that growth <br>
would have been realized. And certainly, nothing like that growth in a <br>
democratic technology of expression would have been realized. <br>

<tt>If you drive </tt>through San Francisco's Presidio, you might see two <br>
gaudy yellow school buses painted over with colorful and striking im-ages, <br>
and the logo "Just Think!" in place of the name of a school. But <br>
there's little that's "just" cerebral in the projects that these busses en-able. <br>
These buses are filled with technologies that teach kids to tinker <br>
with film. Not the film of Eastman. Not even the film of your VCR. <br>
Rather the "film" of digital cameras. Just Think! is a project that en-ables <br>
kids to make films, as a way to understand and critique the filmed <br>
culture that they find all around them. Each year, these busses travel to <br>
more than thirty schools and enable three hundred to five hundred <br>
children to learn something about media by doing something with me-dia. <br>
By doing, they think. By tinkering, they learn. <br>
These buses are not cheap, but the technology they carry is increas-ingly <br>
so. The cost of a high-quality digital video system has fallen dra-matically. <br>
As one analyst puts it, "Five years ago, a good real-time <br>
digital video editing system cost $25,000. Today you can get profes-sional <br>
quality for $595." 9 These buses are filled with technology that <br>
would have cost hundreds of thousands just ten years ago. And it is <br>
now feasible to imagine not just buses like this, but classrooms across <br>
the country where kids are learning more and more of something <br>
teachers call "media literacy." <br>

"Media literacy," as Dave Yanofsky, the executive director of Just <br>
Think!, puts it, "is the ability ... to understand, analyze, and decon-struct <br>
media images. Its aim is to make [kids] literate about the way <br>
media works, the way it's constructed, the way it's delivered, and the <br>
way people access it." <br>
This may seem like an odd way to think about "literacy." For most <br>
people, literacy is about reading and writing. Faulkner and Hemingway <br>
and noticing split infinitives are the things that "literate" people know <br>
about. <br>
Maybe. But in a world where children see on average 390 hours of <br>
television commercials per year, or between 20,000 and 45,000 com-mercials <br>
generally, 10 it is increasingly important to understand the <br>
"grammar" of media. For just as there is a grammar for the written <br>
word, so, too, is there one for media. And just as kids learn how to write <br>
by writing lots of terrible prose, kids learn how to write media by con-structing <br>
lots of (at least at first) terrible media. <br>
A growing field of academics and activists sees this form of literacy <br>
as crucial to the next generation of culture. For though anyone who has <br>
written understands how difficult writing is&mdash;how difficult it is to se-quence <br>
the story, to keep a reader's attention, to craft language to be <br>
understandable&mdash;few of us have any real sense of how difficult media <br>
is. Or more fundamentally, few of us have a sense of how media works, <br>
how it holds an audience or leads it through a story, how it triggers <br>
emotion or builds suspense. <br>
It took filmmaking a generation before it could do these things well. <br>
But even then, the knowledge was in the filming, not in writing about <br>
the film. The skill came from experiencing the making of a film, not <br>
from reading a book about it. One learns to write by writing and then <br>
reflecting upon what one has written. One learns to write with images <br>
by making them and then reflecting upon what one has created. <br>
This grammar has changed as media has changed. When it was just <br>
film, as Elizabeth Daley, executive director of the University of South-ern <br>
California's Annenberg Center for Communication and dean of the <br>

USC School of Cinema-Television, explained to me, the grammar was <br>
about "the placement of objects, color,... rhythm, pacing, and tex-ture." 11 <br>
But as computers open up an interactive space where a story is <br>
"played" as well as experienced, that grammar changes. The simple <br>
control of narrative is lost, and so other techniques are necessary. Au-thor <br>
Michael Crichton had mastered the narrative of science fiction. <br>
But when he tried to design a computer game based on one of his <br>
works, it was a new craft he had to learn. How to lead people through <br>
a game without their feeling they have been led was not obvious, even <br>
to a wildly successful author. 12 <br>
This skill is precisely the craft a filmmaker learns. As Daley de-scribes, <br>
"people are very surprised about how they are led through a <br>
film. [I] t is perfectly constructed to keep you from seeing it, so you <br>
have no idea. If a filmmaker succeeds you do not know how you were <br>
led." If you know you were led through a film, the film has failed. <br>
Yet the push for an expanded literacy&mdash;one that goes beyond text to <br>
include audio and visual elements&mdash;is not about making better film di-rectors. <br>
The aim is not to improve the profession of filmmaking at all. <br>
Instead, as Daley explained, <br>
</p><p>
From my perspective, probably the most important digital divide <br>
is not access to a box. It's the ability to be empowered with the <br>
language that that box works in. Otherwise only a very few people <br>
can write with this language, and all the rest of us are reduced to <br>
being read-only. <br>
</p><p>
"Read-only." Passive recipients of culture produced elsewhere. <br>
Couch potatoes. Consumers. This is the world of media from the <br>
twentieth century. <br>
The twenty-first century could be different. This is the crucial point: <br>
It could be both read and write. Or at least reading and better under-standing <br>
the craft of writing. Or best, reading and understanding the <br>
tools that enable the writing to lead or mislead. The aim of any literacy, <br>

</p><p>
and this literacy in particular, is to "empower people to choose the appro-priate <br>
language for what they need to create or express." 13 It is to enable <br>
students "to communicate in the language of the twenty-first century." 14 <br>
As with any language, this language comes more easily to some <br>
than to others. It doesn't necessarily come more easily to those who ex-cel <br>
in written language. Daley and Stephanie Barish, director of the In-stitute <br>
for Multimedia Literacy at the Annenberg Center, describe one <br>
particularly poignant example of a project they ran in a high school. <br>
The high school was a very poor inner-city Los Angeles school. In all <br>
the traditional measures of success, this school was a failure. But Daley <br>
and Barish ran a program that gave kids an opportunity to use film <br>
to express meaning about something the students know something <br>
about&mdash;gun violence. <br>
The class was held on Friday afternoons, and it created a relatively <br>
new problem for the school. While the challenge in most classes was <br>
getting the kids to come, the challenge in this class was keeping them <br>
away. The "kids were showing up at 6 A. M. and leaving at 5 at night," <br>
said Barish. They were working harder than in any other class to do <br>
what education should be about&mdash;learning how to express themselves. <br>
Using whatever "free web stuff they could find," and relatively sim-ple <br>
tools to enable the kids to mix "image, sound, and text," Barish said <br>
this class produced a series of projects that showed something about <br>
gun violence that few would otherwise understand. This was an issue <br>
close to the lives of these students. The project "gave them a tool and <br>
empowered them to be able to both understand it and talk about it," <br>
Barish explained. That tool succeeded in creating expression&mdash;far more <br>
successfully and powerfully than could have been created using only <br>
text. "If you had said to these students, 'you have to do it in text, ' they <br>
would've just thrown their hands up and gone and done something <br>
else," Barish described, in part, no doubt, because expressing them-selves <br>
in text is not something these students can do well. Yet neither <br>
is text a form in which <i>these </i>ideas can be expressed well. The power of <br>
this message depended upon its connection to this form of expression. <br>

"But isn't education about teaching kids to write?" I asked. In part, <br>
of course, it is. But why are we teaching kids to write? Education, Da-ley <br>
explained, is about giving students a way of "constructing mean-ing." <br>
To say that that means just writing is like saying teaching writing <br>
is only about teaching kids how to spell. Text is one part&mdash;and increas-ingly, <br>
not the most powerful part&mdash;of constructing meaning. As Daley <br>
explained in the most moving part of our interview, <br>
</p><p>
What you want is to give these students ways of constructing <br>
meaning. If all you give them is text, they're not going to do it. <br>
Because they can't. You know, you've got Johnny who can look at <br>
a video, he can play a video game, he can do graffiti all over your <br>
walls, he can take your car apart, and he can do all sorts of other <br>
things. He just can't read your text. So Johnny comes to school <br>
and you say, "Johnny, you're illiterate. Nothing you can do mat-ters." <br>
Well, Johnny then has two choices: He can dismiss you or <br>
he [can] dismiss himself. If his ego is healthy at all, he's going to <br>
dismiss you. [But i] nstead, if you say, "Well, with all these things <br>
that you can do, let's talk about this issue. Play for me music that <br>
you think reflects that, or show me images that you think reflect <br>
that, or draw for me something that reflects that." Not by giving <br>
a kid a video camera and ... saying," Let's go have fun with the <br>
video camera and make a little movie." But instead, really help <br>
you take these elements that you understand, that are your lan-guage, <br>
and construct meaning about the topic. . . . <br>
That empowers enormously. And then what happens, of <br>
course, is eventually, as it has happened in all these classes, they <br>
bump up against the fact, "I need to explain this and I really need <br>
to write something." And as one of the teachers told Stephanie, <br>
they would rewrite a paragraph 5, 6, 7, 8 times, till they got it right. <br>
Because they needed to. There was a reason for doing it. They <br>
needed to say something, as opposed to just jumping through <br>
your hoops. They actually needed to use a language that they <br>

didn't speak very well. But they had come to understand that they <br>
had a lot of power with this language." <br>
</p><p>
<tt>When two planes </tt>crashed into the World Trade Center, another into <br>
the Pentagon, and a fourth into a Pennsylvania field, all media around <br>
the world shifted to this news. Every moment of just about every day for <br>
that week, and for weeks after, television in particular, and media gener-ally, <br>
retold the story of the events we had just witnessed. The telling was <br>
a retelling, because we had seen the events that were described. The ge-nius <br>
of this awful act of terrorism was that the delayed second attack was <br>
perfectly timed to assure that the whole world would be watching. <br>
These retellings had an increasingly familiar feel. There was music <br>
scored for the intermissions, and fancy graphics that flashed across the <br>
screen. There was a formula to interviews. There was "balance," and <br>
seriousness. This was news choreographed in the way we have increas-ingly <br>
come to expect it, "news as entertainment," even if the entertain-ment <br>
is tragedy. <br>
But in addition to this produced news about the "tragedy of Sep-tember <br>
11," those of us tied to the Internet came to see a very different <br>
production as well. The Internet was filled with accounts of the same <br>
events. Yet these Internet accounts had a very different flavor. Some <br>
people constructed photo pages that captured images from around the <br>
world and presented them as slide shows with text. Some offered open <br>
letters. There were sound recordings. There was anger and frustration. <br>
There were attempts to provide context. There was, in short, an ex-traordinary <br>
worldwide barn raising, in the sense Mike Godwin uses <br>
the term in his book <i>Cyber Rights, </i>around a news event that had cap-tured <br>
the attention of the world. There was ABC and CBS, but there <br>
was also the Internet. <br>
I don't mean simply to praise the Internet&mdash;though I do think the <br>
people who supported this form of speech should be praised. I mean <br>
instead to point to a significance in this form of speech. For like a Ko-dak, <br>
the Internet enables people to capture images. And like in a movie <br>

by a student on the "Just Think!" bus, the visual images could be mixed <br>
with sound or text. <br>
But unlike any technology for simply capturing images, the Inter-net <br>
allows these creations to be shared with an extraordinary number of <br>
people, practically instantaneously. This is something new in our tradi-tion&mdash;<br>
not just that culture can be captured mechanically, and obviously <br>
not just that events are commented upon critically, but that this mix of <br>
captured images, sound, and commentary can be widely spread practi-cally <br>

September 11 was not an aberration. It was a beginning. Around <br>
the same time, a form of communication that has grown dramatically <br>
was just beginning to come into public consciousness: the Web-log, or <br>
blog. The blog is a kind of public diary, and within some cultures, such <br>
as in Japan, it functions very much like a diary. In those cultures, it <br>
records private facts in a public way&mdash;it's a kind of electronic <i>Jerry <br>
Springer, </i>available anywhere in the world. <br>
But in the United States, blogs have taken on a very different char-acter. <br>
There are some who use the space simply to talk about their pri-vate <br>
life. But there are many who use the space to engage in public <br>
discourse. Discussing matters of public import, criticizing others who <br>
are mistaken in their views, criticizing politicians about the decisions <br>
they make, offering solutions to problems we all see: blogs create the <br>
sense of a virtual public meeting, but one in which we don't all hope to <br>
be there at the same time and in which conversations are not necessar-ily <br>
linked. The best of the blog entries are relatively short; they point <br>
directly to words used by others, criticizing with or adding to them. <br>
They are arguably the most important form of unchoreographed pub-lic <br>
discourse that we have. <br>
That's a strong statement. Yet it says as much about our democracy <br>
as it does about blogs. This is the part of America that is most difficult <br>
for those of us who love America to accept: Our democracy has atro-phied. <br>
Of course we have elections, and most of the time the courts al-low <br>
those elections to count. A relatively small number of people vote <br>

</p><p>
in those elections. The cycle of these elections has become totally pro-fessionalized <br>
and routinized. Most of us think this is democracy. <br>
But democracy has never just been about elections. Democracy <br>
means rule by the people, but rule means something more than mere <br>
elections. In our tradition, it also means control through reasoned dis-course. <br>
This was the idea that captured the imagination of Alexis de <br>
Tocqueville, the nineteenth-century French lawyer who wrote the <br>
most important account of early "Democracy in America." It wasn't <br>
popular elections that fascinated him&mdash;it was the jury, an institution <br>
that gave ordinary people the right to choose life or death for other cit-izens. <br>
And most fascinating for him was that the jury didn't just vote <br>
about the outcome they would impose. They deliberated. Members ar-gued <br>
about the "right" result; they tried to persuade each other of the <br>
"right" result, and in criminal cases at least, they had to agree upon a <br>
unanimous result for the process to come to an end. 15 <br>
Yet even this institution flags in American life today. And in its <br>
place, there is no systematic effort to enable citizen deliberation. Some <br>
are pushing to create just such an institution. 16 And in some towns in <br>
New England, something close to deliberation remains. But for most <br>
of us for most of the time, there is no time or place for "democratic de-liberation" <br>
to occur. <br>
More bizarrely, there is generally not even permission for it to oc-cur. <br>
We, the most powerful democracy in the world, have developed a <br>
strong norm against talking about politics. It's fine to talk about poli-tics <br>
with people you agree with. But it is rude to argue about politics <br>
with people you disagree with. Political discourse becomes isolated, <br>
and isolated discourse becomes more extreme. 17 We say what our <br>
friends want to hear, and hear very little beyond what our friends say. <br>
Enter the blog. The blog's very architecture solves one part of this <br>
problem. People post when they want to post, and people read when <br>
they want to read. The most difficult time is synchronous time. Tech-nologies <br>
that enable asynchronous communication, such as e-mail, <br>
increase the opportunity for communication. Blogs allow for public <br>

<br>

discourse without the public ever needing to gather in a single public <br>
place. <br>
But beyond architecture, blogs also have solved the problem of <br>
norms. There's no norm (yet) in blog space not to talk about politics. <br>
Indeed, the space is filled with political speech, on both the right and <br>
the left. Some of the most popular sites are conservative or libertarian, <br>
but there are many of all political stripes. And even blogs that are not <br>
political cover political issues when the occasion merits. <br>
The significance of these blogs is tiny now, though not so tiny. The <br>
name Howard Dean may well have faded from the 2004 presidential <br>
race but for blogs. Yet even if the number of readers is small, the read-ing <br>
is having an effect. <br>
One direct effect is on stories that had a different life cycle in the <br>
mainstream media. The Trent Lott affair is an example. When Lott <br>
"misspoke" at a party for Senator Strom Thurmond, essentially prais-ing <br>
Thurmond's segregationist policies, he calculated correctly that this <br>
story would disappear from the mainstream press within forty-eight <br>
hours. It did. But he didn't calculate its life cycle in blog space. The <br>
bloggers kept researching the story. Over time, more and more in-stances <br>
of the same "misspeaking" emerged. Finally, the story broke <br>
back into the mainstream press. In the end, Lott was forced to resign <br>
as senate majority leader. 18 <br>
This different cycle is possible because the same commercial pres-sures <br>
don't exist with blogs as with other ventures. Television and <br>
newspapers are commercial entities. They must work to keep attention. <br>
If they lose readers, they lose revenue. Like sharks, they must move on. <br>
But bloggers don't have a similar constraint. They can obsess, they <br>
can focus, they can get serious. If a particular blogger writes a particu-larly <br>
interesting story, more and more people link to that story. And as <br>
the number of links to a particular story increases, it rises in the ranks <br>
of stories. People read what is popular; what is popular has been se-lected <br>
by a very democratic process of peer-generated rankings. <br>
There's a second way, as well, in which blogs have a different cycle <br>

from the mainstream press. As Dave Winer, one of the fathers of this <br>
movement and a software author for many decades, told me, another <br>
difference is the absence of a financial "conflict of interest." "I think you <br>
have to take the conflict of interest" out of journalism, Winer told me. <br>
"An amateur journalist simply doesn't have a conflict of interest, or the <br>
conflict of interest is so easily disclosed that you know you can sort of <br>
get it out of the way." <br>
These conflicts become more important as media becomes more <br>
concentrated (more on this below). A concentrated media can hide <br>
more from the public than an unconcentrated media can&mdash;as CNN <br>
admitted it did after the Iraq war because it was afraid of the conse-quences <br>
to its own employees. 19 It also needs to sustain a more coher-ent <br>
account. (In the middle of the Iraq war, I read a post on the <br>
Internet from someone who was at that time listening to a satellite up-link <br>
with a reporter in Iraq. The New York headquarters was telling the <br>
reporter over and over that her account of the war was too bleak: She <br>
needed to offer a more optimistic story. When she told New York that <br>
wasn't warranted, they told her that <i>they </i>were writing "the story.") <br>
Blog space gives amateurs a way to enter the debate&ndash;" amateur" not <br>
in the sense of inexperienced, but in the sense of an Olympic athlete, <br>
meaning not paid by anyone to give their reports. It allows for a much <br>
broader range of input into a story, as reporting on the Columbia dis-aster <br>
revealed, when hundreds from across the southwest United States <br>
turned to the Internet to retell what they had seen. 20 And it drives <br>
readers to read across the range of accounts and "triangulate," as Winer <br>
puts it, the truth. Blogs, Winer says, are "communicating directly with <br>
our constituency, and the middle man is out of it"&mdash;with all the bene-fits, <br>
and costs, that might entail. <br>
Winer is optimistic about the future of journalism infected with <br>
blogs. "It's going to become an essential skill," Winer predicts, for pub-lic <br>
figures and increasingly for private figures as well. It's not clear that <br>
"journalism" is happy about this&mdash;some journalists have been told to <br>
curtail their blogging. 21 But it is clear that we are still in transition. "A <br>

<br>

lot of what we are doing now is warm-up exercises," Winer told me. <br>
There is a lot that must mature before this space has its mature effect. <br>
And as the inclusion of content in this space is the least infringing use <br>
of the Internet (meaning infringing on copyright), Winer said, "we will <br>
be the last thing that gets shut down." <br>
This speech affects democracy. Winer thinks that happens because <br>
"you don't have to work for somebody who controls, [for] a gate-keeper." <br>
That is true. But it affects democracy in another way as well. <br>
As more and more citizens express what they think, and defend it in <br>
writing, that will change the way people understand public issues. It is <br>
easy to be wrong and misguided in your head. It is harder when the <br>
product of your mind can be criticized by others. Of course, it is a rare <br>
human who admits that he has been persuaded that he is wrong. But it <br>
is even rarer for a human to ignore when he has been proven wrong. <br>
The writing of ideas, arguments, and criticism improves democracy. <br>
Today there are probably a couple of million blogs where such writing <br>
happens. When there are ten million, there will be something extraor-dinary <br>
to report. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>John Seely Brown </tt>is the chief scientist of the Xerox Corporation. <br>
His work, as his Web site describes it, is "human learning and ... the <br>
creation of knowledge ecologies for creating ... innovation." <br>
Brown thus looks at these technologies of digital creativity a bit dif-ferently <br>
from the perspectives I've sketched so far. I'm sure he would be <br>
excited about any technology that might improve democracy. But his <br>
real excitement comes from how these technologies affect learning. <br>
As Brown believes, we learn by tinkering. When "a lot of us grew <br>
up," he explains, that tinkering was done "on motorcycle engines, lawn-mower <br>
engines, automobiles, radios, and so on." But digital technolo-gies <br>
enable a different kind of tinkering&mdash;with abstract ideas though <br>
in concrete form. The kids at Just Think! not only think about how <br>
a commercial portrays a politician; using digital technology, they can <br>

<br>
</p><p>
take the commercial apart and manipulate it, tinker with it to see how <br>
it does what it does. Digital technologies launch a kind of bricolage, or <br>
"free collage," as Brown calls it. Many get to add to or transform the <br>
tinkering of many others. <br>
The best large-scale example of this kind of tinkering so far is free <br>
software or open-source software (FS/ OSS). FS/ OSS is software whose <br>
source code is shared. Anyone can download the technology that makes <br>
a FS/ OSS program run. And anyone eager to learn how a particular bit <br>
of FS/ OSS technology works can tinker with the code. <br>
This opportunity creates a "completely new kind of learning plat-form," <br>
as Brown describes. "As soon as you start doing that, you . . . <br>
unleash a free collage on the community, so that other people can start <br>
looking at your code, tinkering with it, trying it out, seeing if they can <br>
improve it." Each effort is a kind of apprenticeship. "Open source be-comes <br>
a major apprenticeship platform." <br>
In this process, "the concrete things you tinker with are abstract. <br>
They are code." Kids are "shifting to the ability to tinker in the ab-stract, <br>
and this tinkering is no longer an isolated activity that you're do-ing <br>
in your garage. You are tinkering with a community platform. . . . <br>
You are tinkering with other people's stuff. The more you tinker the <br>
more you improve." The more you improve, the more you learn. <br>
This same thing happens with content, too. And it happens in the <br>
same collaborative way when that content is part of the Web. As <br>
Brown puts it, "the Web [is] the first medium that truly honors multi-ple <br>
forms of intelligence." Earlier technologies, such as the typewriter <br>
or word processors, helped amplify text. But the Web amplifies much <br>
more than text. "The Web ... says if you are musical, if you are artis-tic, <br>
if you are visual, if you are interested in film ...[ then] there is a lot <br>
you can start to do on this medium. [It] can now amplify and honor <br>
these multiple forms of intelligence." <br>
Brown is talking about what Elizabeth Daley, Stephanie Barish, <br>
and Just Think! teach: that this tinkering with culture teaches as well <br>

as creates. It develops talents differently, and it builds a different kind <br>
of recognition. <br>
Yet the freedom to tinker with these objects is not guaranteed. In-deed, <br>
as we'll see through the course of this book, that freedom is in-creasingly <br>
highly contested. While there's no doubt that your father <br>
had the right to tinker with the car engine, there's great doubt that your <br>
child will have the right to tinker with the images she finds all around. <br>
The law and, increasingly, technology interfere with a freedom that <br>
technology, and curiosity, would otherwise ensure. <br>
These restrictions have become the focus of researchers and schol-ars. <br>
Professor Ed Felten of Princeton (whom we'll see more of in chap-ter <br>
10) has developed a powerful argument in favor of the "right to <br>
tinker" as it applies to computer science and to knowledge in general. 22 <br>
But Brown's concern is earlier, or younger, or more fundamental. It is <br>
about the learning that kids can do, or can't do, because of the law. <br>
"This is where education in the twenty-first century is going," <br>
Brown explains. We need to "understand how kids who grow up digi-tal <br>
think and want to learn." <br>
"Yet," as Brown continued, and as the balance of this book will <br>
evince, "we are building a legal system that completely suppresses the <br>
natural tendencies of today's digital kids. ... We're building an archi-tecture <br>
that unleashes 60 percent of the brain [and] a legal system that <br>
closes down that part of the brain." <br>
We're building a technology that takes the magic of Kodak, mixes <br>
moving images and sound, and adds a space for commentary and an <br>
opportunity to spread that creativity everywhere. But we're building <br>
the law to close down that technology. <br>
"No way to run a culture," as Brewster Kahle, whom we'll meet in <br>
chapter 9, quipped to me in a rare moment of despondence. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER THREE: Catalogs <br>
In the fall of </tt>2002, Jesse Jordan of Oceanside, New York, enrolled <br>
as a freshman at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, New York. <br>
His major at RPI was information technology. Though he is not a pro-grammer, <br>
in October Jesse decided to begin to tinker with search en-gine <br>
technology that was available on the RPI network. <br>
RPI is one of America's foremost technological research institu-tions. <br>
It offers degrees in fields ranging from architecture and engi-neering <br>
to information sciences. More than 65 percent of its five <br>
thousand undergraduates finished in the top 10 percent of their high <br>
school class. The school is thus a perfect mix of talent and experience <br>
to imagine and then build, a generation for the network age. <br>
RPI's computer network links students, faculty, and administration <br>
to one another. It also links RPI to the Internet. Not everything avail-able <br>
on the RPI network is available on the Internet. But the network <br>
is designed to enable students to get access to the Internet, as well as <br>
more intimate access to other members of the RPI community. <br>
Search engines are a measure of a network's intimacy. Google <br>
</p><p>

<br>

brought the Internet much closer to all of us by fantastically improving <br>
the quality of search on the network. Specialty search engines can do <br>
this even better. The idea of "intranet" search engines, search engines <br>
that search within the network of a particular institution, is to provide <br>
users of that institution with better access to material from that insti-tution. <br>
Businesses do this all the time, enabling employees to have ac-cess <br>
to material that people outside the business can't get. Universities <br>
do it as well. <br>
These engines are enabled by the network technology itself. Mi-crosoft, <br>
for example, has a network file system that makes it very easy <br>
for search engines tuned to that network to query the system for infor-mation <br>
about the publicly (within that network) available content. <br>
Jesse's search engine was built to take advantage of this technology. It <br>
used Microsoft's network file system to build an index of all the files <br>
available within the RPI network. <br>
Jesse's wasn't the first search engine built for the RPI network. In-deed, <br>
his engine was a simple modification of engines that others had <br>
built. His single most important improvement over those engines was <br>
to fix a bug within the Microsoft file-sharing system that could cause a <br>
user's computer to crash. With the engines that existed before, if you <br>
tried to access a file through a Windows browser that was on a com-puter <br>
that was off-line, your computer could crash. Jesse modified the <br>
system a bit to fix that problem, by adding a button that a user could <br>
click to see if the machine holding the file was still on-line. <br>
Jesse's engine went on-line in late October. Over the following six <br>
months, he continued to tweak it to improve its functionality. By <br>
March, the system was functioning quite well. Jesse had more than one <br>
million files in his directory, including every type of content that might <br>
be on users' computers. <br>
Thus the index his search engine produced included pictures, <br>
which students could use to put on their own Web sites; copies of notes <br>
or research; copies of information pamphlets; movie clips that stu-dents <br>
might have created; university brochures&mdash;basically anything that <br>

<a href="#page65">65</a>
<br>
</p><p>
users of the RPI network made available in a public folder of their <br>
computer. <br>
But the index also included music files. In fact, one quarter of the <br>
files that Jesse's search engine listed were music files. But that means, <br>
of course, that three quarters were not, and&mdash;so that this point is ab-solutely <br>
clear&mdash;Jesse did nothing to induce people to put music files in <br>
their public folders. He did nothing to target the search engine to these <br>
files. He was a kid tinkering with a Google-like technology at a uni-versity <br>
where he was studying information science, and hence, tinker-ing <br>
was the aim. Unlike Google, or Microsoft, for that matter, he made <br>
no money from this tinkering; he was not connected to any business <br>
that would make any money from this experiment. He was a kid tin-kering <br>
with technology in an environment where tinkering with tech-nology <br>
was precisely what he was supposed to do. <br>
On April 3, 2003, Jesse was contacted by the dean of students at <br>
RPI. The dean informed Jesse that the Recording Industry Association <br>
of America, the RIAA, would be filing a lawsuit against him and three <br>
other students whom he didn't even know, two of them at other uni-versities. <br>
A few hours later, Jesse was served with papers from the suit. <br>
As he read these papers and watched the news reports about them, he <br>
was increasingly astonished. <br>
"It was absurd," he told me. "I don't think I did anything wrong.... <br>
I don't think there's anything wrong with the search engine that I ran <br>
or ... what I had done to it. I mean, I hadn't modified it in any way <br>
that promoted or enhanced the work of pirates. I just modified the <br>
search engine in a way that would make it easier to use"&mdash;again, a <br>
<i>search engine, </i>which Jesse had not himself built, using the Windows file-sharing <br>
system, which Jesse had not himself built, to enable members <br>
of the RPI community to get access to content, which Jesse had not <br>
himself created or posted, and the vast majority of which had nothing <br>
to do with music. <br>
But the RIAA branded Jesse a pirate. They claimed he operated a <br>
network and had therefore "willfully" violated copyright laws. They de-50 <br>

<br>

manded that he pay them the damages for his wrong. For cases of <br>
"willful infringement," the Copyright Act specifies something lawyers <br>
call "statutory damages." These damages permit a copyright owner to <br>
claim $150,000 per infringement. As the RIAA alleged more than one <br>
hundred specific copyright infringements, they therefore demanded <br>
that Jesse pay them at least $15,000,000. <br>
Similar lawsuits were brought against three other students: one <br>
other student at RPI, one at Michigan Technical University, and one at <br>
Princeton. Their situations were similar to Jesse's. Though each case <br>
was different in detail, the bottom line in each was exactly the same: <br>
huge demands for "damages" that the RIAA claimed it was entitled to. <br>
If you added up the claims, these four lawsuits were asking courts in <br>
the United States to award the plaintiffs close to $100 <i>billion&mdash;</i>six <br>
times the <i>total </i>profit of the film industry in 2001. 1 <br>
Jesse called his parents. They were supportive but a bit frightened. <br>
An uncle was a lawyer. He began negotiations with the RIAA. They <br>
demanded to know how much money Jesse had. Jesse had saved <br>
$12,000 from summer jobs and other employment. They demanded <br>
$12,000 to dismiss the case. <br>
The RIAA wanted Jesse to admit to doing something wrong. He <br>
refused. They wanted him to agree to an injunction that would essen-tially <br>
make it impossible for him to work in many fields of technology <br>
for the rest of his life. He refused. They made him understand that this <br>
process of being sued was not going to be pleasant. (As Jesse's father <br>
recounted to me, the chief lawyer on the case, Matt Oppenheimer, told <br>
Jesse, "You don't want to pay another visit to a dentist like me.") And <br>
throughout, the RIAA insisted it would not settle the case until it took <br>
every penny Jesse had saved. <br>
Jesse's family was outraged at these claims. They wanted to fight. <br>
But Jesse's uncle worked to educate the family about the nature of the <br>
American legal system. Jesse could fight the RIAA. He might even <br>
win. But the cost of fighting a lawsuit like this, Jesse was told, would be <br>
at least $250,000. If he won, he would not recover that money. If he <br>

<br>
</p><p>
won, he would have a piece of paper saying he had won, and a piece of <br>
paper saying he and his family were bankrupt. <br>
So Jesse faced a mafia-like choice: $250,000 and a chance at win-ning, <br>
or $12,000 and a settlement. <br>
The recording industry insists this is a matter of law and morality. <br>
Let's put the law aside for a moment and think about the morality. <br>
Where is the morality in a lawsuit like this? What is the virtue in <br>
scapegoatism? The RIAA is an extraordinarily powerful lobby. The <br>
president of the RIAA is reported to make more than $1 million a year. <br>
Artists, on the other hand, are not well paid. The average recording <br>
artist makes $45,900. 2 There are plenty of ways for the RIAA to affect <br>
and direct policy. So where is the morality in taking money from a stu-dent <br>
for running a search engine? 3 <br>
On June 23, Jesse wired his savings to the lawyer working for the <br>
RIAA. The case against him was then dismissed. And with this, this <br>
kid who had tinkered a computer into a $15 million lawsuit became an <br>
activist: <br>
</p><p>
I was definitely not an activist [before]. I never really meant to be <br>
an activist. ...[ But] I've been pushed into this. In no way did I <br>
ever foresee anything like this, but I think it's just completely ab-surd <br>
what the RIAA has done. <br>
</p><p>
Jesse's parents betray a certain pride in their reluctant activist. As <br>
his father told me, Jesse "considers himself very conservative, and so do <br>
I. ... He's not a tree hugger.... I think it's bizarre that they would <br>
pick on him. But he wants to let people know that they're sending the <br>
wrong message. And he wants to correct the record." <br>

and directors migrated from the East Coast to California in the early <br>
twentieth century in part to escape controls that patents granted the <br>
inventor of filmmaking, Thomas Edison. These controls were exer-cised <br>
through a monopoly "trust," the Motion Pictures Patents Com-pany, <br>
and were based on Thomas Edison's creative property&mdash;patents. <br>
Edison formed the MPPC to exercise the rights this creative property <br>

gave him, and the MPPC was serious about the control it demanded. <br>
As one commentator tells one part of the story, <br>
</p><p>
A January 1909 deadline was set for all companies to comply with <br>
the license. By February, unlicensed outlaws, who referred to <br>
themselves as independents protested the trust and carried on <br>
business without submitting to the Edison monopoly. In the <br>
summer of 1909 the independent movement was in full-swing, <br>
with producers and theater owners using illegal equipment and <br>
imported film stock to create their own underground market. <br>
With the country experiencing a tremendous expansion in the <br>
number of nickelodeons, the Patents Company reacted to the in-dependent <br>
movement by forming a strong-arm subsidiary known <br>
as the General Film Company to block the entry of non-licensed <br>
independents. With coercive tactics that have become legendary, <br>
General Film confiscated unlicensed equipment, discontinued <br>
product supply to theaters which showed unlicensed films, and <br>
effectively monopolized distribution with the acquisition of all <br>
U. S. film exchanges, except for the one owned by the independent <br>
William Fox who defied the Trust even after his license was re-voked. 2 <br>
</p><p>
The Napsters of those days, the "independents," were companies like <br>
Fox. And no less than today, these independents were vigorously re-sisted. <br>
"Shooting was disrupted by machinery stolen, and 'accidents' <br>
resulting in loss of negatives, equipment, buildings and sometimes life <br>
and limb frequently occurred." 3 That led the independents to flee the <br>
East Coast. California was remote enough from Edison's reach that film-makers <br>
there could pirate his inventions without fear of the law. And the <br>
leaders of Hollywood filmmaking, Fox most prominently, did just that. <br>
Of course, California grew quickly, and the effective enforcement <br>
of federal law eventually spread west. But because patents grant the <br>
patent holder a truly "limited" monopoly (just seventeen years at that <br>

time), by the time enough federal marshals appeared, the patents had <br>
expired. A new industry had been born, in part from the piracy of Edi-son's <br>
creative property. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Recorded Music <br>
</tt>The record industry was born of another kind of piracy, though to see <br>
how requires a bit of detail about the way the law regulates music. <br>
At the time that Edison and Henri Fourneaux invented machines <br>
for reproducing music (Edison the phonograph, Fourneaux the player <br>
piano), the law gave composers the exclusive right to control copies of <br>
their music and the exclusive right to control public performances of <br>
their music. In other words, in 1900, if I wanted a copy of Phil Russel's <br>
1899 hit "Happy Mose," the law said I would have to pay for the right <br>
to get a copy of the musical score, and I would also have to pay for the <br>
right to perform it publicly. <br>
But what if I wanted to record "Happy Mose," using Edison's <br>
phonograph or Fourneaux's player piano? Here the law stumbled. It was <br>
clear enough that I would have to buy any copy of the musical score that <br>
I performed in making this recording. And it was clear enough that I <br>
would have to pay for any public performance of the work I was record-ing. <br>
But it wasn't totally clear that I would have to pay for a "public per-formance" <br>
if I recorded the song in my own house (even today, you don't <br>
owe the Beatles anything if you sing their songs in the shower), or if I <br>
recorded the song from memory (copies in your brain are not&mdash;yet&mdash;<br>
regulated by copyright law). So if I simply sang the song into a record-ing <br>
device in the privacy of my own home, it wasn't clear that I owed the <br>
composer anything. And more importantly, it wasn't clear whether I <br>
owed the composer anything if I then made copies of those recordings. <br>
Because of this gap in the law, then, I could effectively pirate someone <br>
else's song without paying its composer anything. <br>
The composers (and publishers) were none too happy about <br>

<br>
</p><p>
this capacity to pirate. As South Dakota senator Alfred Kittredge <br>
put it, <br>
</p><p>
Imagine the injustice of the thing. A composer writes a song or an <br>
opera. A publisher buys at great expense the rights to the same and <br>
copyrights it. Along come the phonographic companies and compa-nies <br>
who cut music rolls and deliberately steal the work of the brain <br>
of the composer and publisher without any regard for [their] rights. 4 <br>
</p><p>
The innovators who developed the technology to record other <br>
people's works were "sponging upon the toil, the work, the talent, and <br>
genius of American composers," 5 and the "music publishing industry" <br>
was thereby "at the complete mercy of this one pirate." 6 As John Philip <br>
Sousa put it, in as direct a way as possible, "When they make money <br>
out of my pieces, I want a share of it." 7 <br>
These arguments have familiar echoes in the wars of our day. So, <br>
too, do the arguments on the other side. The innovators who devel-oped <br>
the player piano argued that "it is perfectly demonstrable that the <br>
introduction of automatic music players has not deprived any com-poser <br>
of anything he had before their introduction." Rather, the ma-chines <br>
increased the sales of sheet music. 8 In any case, the innovators <br>
argued, the job of Congress was "to consider first the interest of [the <br>
public], whom they represent, and whose servants they are." "All talk <br>
about 'theft, ' " the general counsel of the American Graphophone <br>
Company wrote, "is the merest claptrap, for there exists no property in <br>
ideas musical, literary or artistic, except as defined by statute." 9 <br>
The law soon resolved this battle in favor of the composer <i>and <br>
</i>the recording artist. Congress amended the law to make sure that <br>
composers would be paid for the "mechanical reproductions" of their <br>
music. But rather than simply granting the composer complete con-trol <br>
over the right to make mechanical reproductions, Congress gave <br>
recording artists a right to record the music, at a price set by Congress, <br>
once the composer allowed it to be recorded once. This is the part of <br>

copyright law that makes cover songs possible. Once a composer au-thorizes <br>
a recording of his song, others are free to record the same <br>
song, so long as they pay the original composer a fee set by the law. <br>
American law ordinarily calls this a "compulsory license," but I will <br>
refer to it as a "statutory license." A statutory license is a license whose <br>
key terms are set by law. After Congress's amendment of the Copyright <br>
Act in 1909, record companies were free to distribute copies of record-ings <br>
so long as they paid the composer (or copyright holder) the fee set <br>
by the statute. <br>
This is an exception within the law of copyright. When John Grisham <br>
writes a novel, a publisher is free to publish that novel only if Grisham <br>
gives the publisher permission. Grisham, in turn, is free to charge what-ever <br>
he wants for that permission. The price to publish Grisham is <br>
thus set by Grisham, and copyright law ordinarily says you have no <br>
permission to use Grisham's work except with permission of Grisham. <br>
But the law governing recordings gives recording artists less. And <br>
thus, in effect, the law <i>subsidizes </i>the recording industry through a kind <br>
of piracy&mdash;by giving recording artists a weaker right than it otherwise <br>
gives creative authors. The Beatles have less control over their creative <br>
work than Grisham does. And the beneficiaries of this less control are <br>
the recording industry and the public. The recording industry gets <br>
something of value for less than it otherwise would pay; the public gets <br>
access to a much wider range of musical creativity. Indeed, Congress <br>
was quite explicit about its reasons for granting this right. Its fear was <br>
the monopoly power of rights holders, and that that power would sti-fle <br>
follow-on creativity. 10 <br>
While the recording industry has been quite coy about this recently, <br>
historically it has been quite a supporter of the statutory license for <br>
records. As a 1967 report from the House Committee on the Judiciary <br>
relates, <br>
</p><p>
the record producers argued vigorously that the compulsory <br>
license system must be retained. They asserted that the record in-" <br>

dustry is a half-billion-dollar business of great economic impor-tance <br>
in the United States and throughout the world; records <br>
today are the principal means of disseminating music, and this <br>
creates special problems, since performers need unhampered ac-cess <br>
to musical material on nondiscriminatory terms. Historically, <br>
the record producers pointed out, there were no recording rights <br>
before 1909 and the 1909 statute adopted the compulsory license <br>
as a deliberate anti-monopoly condition on the grant of these <br>
rights. They argue that the result has been an outpouring of <br>
recorded music, with the public being given lower prices, im-proved <br>
quality, and a greater choice. 11 <br>
</p><p>
By limiting the rights musicians have, by partially pirating their cre-ative <br>
work, the record producers, and the public, benefit. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Radio <br>
</tt>Radio was also born of piracy. <br>
When a radio station plays a record on the air, that constitutes a <br>
"public performance" of the composer's work. 12 As I described above, <br>
the law gives the composer (or copyright holder) an exclusive right to <br>
public performances of his work. The radio station thus owes the com-poser <br>
money for that performance. <br>
But when the radio station plays a record, it is not only performing <br>
a copy of the <i>composer's </i>work. The radio station is also performing a <br>
copy of the <i>recording artist's </i>work. It's one thing to have "Happy Birth-day" <br>
sung on the radio by the local children's choir; it's quite another to <br>
have it sung by the Rolling Stones or Lyle Lovett. The recording artist <br>
is adding to the value of the composition performed on the radio sta-tion. <br>
And if the law were perfectly consistent, the radio station would <br>
have to pay the recording artist for his work, just as it pays the com-poser <br>
of the music for his work. <br>

<br>

But it doesn't. Under the law governing radio performances, the ra-dio <br>
station does not have to pay the recording artist. The radio station <br>
need only pay the composer. The radio station thus gets a bit of some-thing <br>
for nothing. It gets to perform the recording artist's work for <br>
free, even if it must pay the composer something for the privilege of <br>
playing the song. <br>
This difference can be huge. Imagine you compose a piece of mu-sic. <br>
Imagine it is your first. You own the exclusive right to authorize <br>
public performances of that music. So if Madonna wants to sing your <br>
song in public, she has to get your permission. <br>
Imagine she does sing your song, and imagine she likes it a lot. She <br>
then decides to make a recording of your song, and it becomes a top <br>
hit. Under our law, every time a radio station plays your song, you get <br>
some money. But Madonna gets nothing, save the indirect effect on <br>
the sale of her CDs. The public performance of her recording is not a <br>
"protected" right. The radio station thus gets to <i>pirate </i>the value of <br>
Madonna's work without paying her anything. <br>
No doubt, one might argue that, on balance, the recording artists <br>
benefit. On average, the promotion they get is worth more than the <br>
performance rights they give up. Maybe. But even if so, the law ordi-narily <br>
gives the creator the right to make this choice. By making the <br>
choice for him or her, the law gives the radio station the right to take <br>
something for nothing. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Cable TV <br>
</tt>Cable TV was also born of a kind of piracy. <br>
When cable entrepreneurs first started wiring communities with <br>
cable television in 1948, most refused to pay broadcasters for the con-tent <br>
that they echoed to their customers. Even when the cable compa-nies <br>
started selling access to television broadcasts, they refused to pay <br>
for what they sold. Cable companies were thus Napsterizing broad-" <br>

</p><p>
casters' content, but more egregiously than anything Napster ever did&mdash;<br>
Napster never charged for the content it enabled others to give away. <br>
Broadcasters and copyright owners were quick to attack this theft. <br>
Rosel Hyde, chairman of the FCC, viewed the practice as a kind of <br>
"unfair and potentially destructive competition." 13 There may have <br>
been a "public interest" in spreading the reach of cable TV, but as Doug-las <br>
Anello, general counsel to the National Association of Broadcast-ers, <br>
asked Senator Quentin Burdick during testimony, "Does public <br>
interest dictate that you use somebody else's property?" 14 As another <br>
broadcaster put it, <br>
</p><p>
The extraordinary thing about the CATV business is that it is the <br>
only business I know of where the product that is being sold is not <br>
paid for. 15 <br>
</p><p>
Again, the demand of the copyright holders seemed reasonable <br>
enough: <br>
</p><p>
All we are asking for is a very simple thing, that people who now <br>
take our property for nothing pay for it. We are trying to stop <br>
piracy and I don't think there is any lesser word to describe it. I <br>
think there are harsher words which would fit it. 16 <br>
</p><p>
These were "free-ride[ rs]," Screen Actor's Guild president Charl-ton <br>
Heston said, who were "depriving actors of compensation." 17 <br>
But again, there was another side to the debate. As Assistant At-torney <br>
General Edwin Zimmerman put it, <br>
</p><p>
Our point here is that unlike the problem of whether you have <br>
any copyright protection at all, the problem here is whether copy-right <br>
holders who are already compensated, who already have a <br>
monopoly, should be permitted to extend that monopoly.... The <br>

<br>

question here is how much compensation they should have and <br>
how far back they should carry their right to compensation. 18 <br>
</p><p>
Copyright owners took the cable companies to court. Twice the <br>
Supreme Court held that the cable companies owed the copyright <br>
owners nothing. <br>
It took Congress almost thirty years before it resolved the question <br>
of whether cable companies had to pay for the content they "pirated." <br>
In the end, Congress resolved this question in the same way that it re-solved <br>
the question about record players and player pianos. Yes, cable <br>
companies would have to pay for the content that they broadcast; but <br>
the price they would have to pay was not set by the copyright owner. <br>
The price was set by law, so that the broadcasters couldn't exercise veto <br>
power over the emerging technologies of cable. Cable companies thus <br>
built their empire in part upon a "piracy" of the value created by broad-casters' <br>
content. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>These separate stories </tt>sing a common theme. If "piracy" <br>
means using value from someone else's creative property without per-mission <br>
from that creator&mdash;as it is increasingly described today 19 &mdash;<br>
then <i>every </i>industry affected by copyright today is the product and <br>
beneficiary of a certain kind of piracy. Film, records, radio, cable <br>
TV.... The list is long and could well be expanded. Every generation <br>
welcomes the pirates from the last. Every generation&mdash;until now. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER FIVE: "Piracy" <br>
There is piracy </tt>of copyrighted material. Lots of it. This piracy <br>
comes in many forms. The most significant is commercial piracy, the <br>
unauthorized taking of other people's content within a commercial <br>
context. Despite the many justifications that are offered in its defense, <br>
this taking is wrong. No one should condone it, and the law should <br>
stop it. <br>
But as well as copy-shop piracy, there is another kind of "taking" <br>
that is more directly related to the Internet. That taking, too, seems <br>
wrong to many, and it is wrong much of the time. Before we paint this <br>
taking "piracy," however, we should understand its nature a bit more. <br>
For the harm of this taking is significantly more ambiguous than out-right <br>
copying, and the law should account for that ambiguity, as it has <br>
so often done in the past. <br>

<br>

<tt>Piracy I <br>
</tt>All across the world, but especially in Asia and Eastern Europe, there <br>
are businesses that do nothing but take others people's copyrighted <br>
content, copy it, and sell it&mdash;all without the permission of a copyright <br>
owner. The recording industry estimates that it loses about $4.6 billion <br>
every year to physical piracy 1 (that works out to one in three CDs sold <br>
worldwide). The MPAA estimates that it loses $3 billion annually <br>
worldwide to piracy. <br>
This is piracy plain and simple. Nothing in the argument of this <br>
book, nor in the argument that most people make when talking about <br>
the subject of this book, should draw into doubt this simple point: <br>
This piracy is wrong. <br>
Which is not to say that excuses and justifications couldn't be made <br>
for it. We could, for example, remind ourselves that for the first one <br>
hundred years of the American Republic, America did not honor for-eign <br>
copyrights. We were born, in this sense, a pirate nation. It might <br>
therefore seem hypocritical for us to insist so strongly that other devel-oping <br>
nations treat as wrong what we, for the first hundred years of our <br>
existence, treated as right. <br>
That excuse isn't terribly strong. Technically, our law did not ban <br>
the taking of foreign works. It explicitly limited itself to American <br>
works. Thus the American publishers who published foreign works <br>
without the permission of foreign authors were not violating any rule. <br>
The copy shops in Asia, by contrast, are violating Asian law. Asian law <br>
does protect foreign copyrights, and the actions of the copy shops vio-late <br>
that law. So the wrong of piracy that they engage in is not just a <br>
moral wrong, but a legal wrong, and not just an internationally legal <br>
wrong, but a locally legal wrong as well. <br>
True, these local rules have, in effect, been imposed upon these <br>
countries. No country can be part of the world economy and choose <br>
not to protect copyright internationally. We may have been born a pi-" <br>

<br>
</p><p>
rate nation, but we will not allow any other nation to have a similar <br>
childhood. <br>
If a country is to be treated as a sovereign, however, then its laws are <br>
its laws regardless of their source. The international law under which <br>
these nations live gives them some opportunities to escape the burden <br>
of intellectual property law. 2 In my view, more developing nations <br>
should take advantage of that opportunity, but when they don't, then <br>
their laws should be respected. And under the laws of these nations, <br>
this piracy is wrong. <br>
Alternatively, we could try to excuse this piracy by noting that in <br>
any case, it does no harm to the industry. The Chinese who get access <br>
to American CDs at 50 cents a copy are not people who would have <br>
bought those American CDs at $15 a copy. So no one really has any <br>
less money than they otherwise would have had. 3 <br>
This is often true (though I have friends who have purchased many <br>
thousands of pirated DVDs who certainly have enough money to pay <br>
for the content they have taken), and it does mitigate to some degree <br>
the harm caused by such taking. Extremists in this debate love to say, <br>
"You wouldn't go into Barnes &amp; Noble and take a book off of the shelf <br>
without paying; why should it be any different with on-line music?" <br>
The difference is, of course, that when you take a book from Barnes &amp; <br>
Noble, it has one less book to sell. By contrast, when you take an MP3 <br>
from a computer network, there is not one less CD that can be sold. <br>
The physics of piracy of the intangible are different from the physics of <br>
piracy of the tangible. <br>
This argument is still very weak. However, although copyright is a <br>
property right of a very special sort, it <i>is </i>a property right. Like all prop-erty <br>
rights, the copyright gives the owner the right to decide the terms <br>
under which content is shared. If the copyright owner doesn't want to <br>
sell, she doesn't have to. There are exceptions: important statutory li-censes <br>
that apply to copyrighted content regardless of the wish of the <br>
copyright owner. Those licenses give people the right to "take" copy-righted <br>
content whether or not the copyright owner wants to sell. But <br>

<br>

where the law does not give people the right to take content, it is <br>
wrong to take that content even if the wrong does no harm. If we have <br>
a property system, and that system is properly balanced to the technol-ogy <br>
of a time, then it is wrong to take property without the permission <br>
of a property owner. That is exactly what "property" means. <br>
Finally, we could try to excuse this piracy with the argument that <br>
the piracy actually helps the copyright owner. When the Chinese <br>
"steal" Windows, that makes the Chinese dependent on Microsoft. <br>
Microsoft loses the value of the software that was taken. But it gains <br>
users who are used to life in the Microsoft world. Over time, as the na-tion <br>
grows more wealthy, more and more people will buy software <br>
rather than steal it. And hence over time, because that buying will ben-efit <br>
Microsoft, Microsoft benefits from the piracy. If instead of pirating <br>
Microsoft Windows, the Chinese used the free GNU/ Linux operating <br>
system, then these Chinese users would not eventually be buying Mi-crosoft. <br>
Without piracy, then, Microsoft would lose. <br>
This argument, too, is somewhat true. The addiction strategy is a <br>
good one. Many businesses practice it. Some thrive because of it. Law <br>
students, for example, are given free access to the two largest legal <br>
databases. The companies marketing both hope the students will be-come <br>
so used to their service that they will want to use it and not the <br>
other when they become lawyers (and must pay high subscription fees). <br>
Still, the argument is not terribly persuasive. We don't give the al-coholic <br>
a defense when he steals his first beer, merely because that will <br>
make it more likely that he will buy the next three. Instead, we ordi-narily <br>
allow businesses to decide for themselves when it is best to give <br>
their product away. If Microsoft fears the competition of GNU/ Linux, <br>
then Microsoft can give its product away, as it did, for example, with <br>
Internet Explorer to fight Netscape. A property right means giv-ing <br>
the property owner the right to say who gets access to what&mdash;at <br>
least ordinarily. And if the law properly balances the rights of the copy-right <br>
owner with the rights of access, then violating the law is still <br>
wrong. <br>

Thus, while I understand the pull of these justifications for piracy, <br>
and I certainly see the motivation, in my view, in the end, these efforts <br>
at justifying commercial piracy simply don't cut it. This kind of piracy <br>
is rampant and just plain wrong. It doesn't transform the content it <br>
steals; it doesn't transform the market it competes in. It merely gives <br>
someone access to something that the law says he should not have. <br>
Nothing has changed to draw that law into doubt. This form of piracy <br>
is flat out wrong. <br>
But as the examples from the four chapters that introduced this <br>
part suggest, even if some piracy is plainly wrong, not all "piracy" is. Or <br>
at least, not all "piracy" is wrong if that term is understood in the way <br>
it is increasingly used today. Many kinds of "piracy" are useful and pro-ductive, <br>
to produce either new content or new ways of doing business. <br>
Neither our tradition nor any tradition has ever banned all "piracy" in <br>
that sense of the term. <br>
This doesn't mean that there are no questions raised by the latest <br>
piracy concern, peer-to-peer file sharing. But it does mean that we <br>
need to understand the harm in peer-to-peer sharing a bit more before <br>
we condemn it to the gallows with the charge of piracy. <br>
For (1) like the original Hollywood, p2p sharing escapes an overly <br>
controlling industry; and (2) like the original recording industry, it <br>
simply exploits a new way to distribute content; but (3) unlike cable <br>
TV, no one is selling the content that is shared on p2p services. <br>
These differences distinguish p2p sharing from true piracy. They <br>
should push us to find a way to protect artists while enabling this shar-ing <br>
to survive. <br>

the author of [his] profit." 4 This means we must determine whether <br>
and how much p2p sharing harms before we know how strongly the <br>

law should seek to either prevent it or find an alternative to assure the <br>
author of his profit. <br>
Peer-to-peer sharing was made famous by Napster. But the inventors <br>
of the Napster technology had not made any major technological inno-vations. <br>
Like every great advance in innovation on the Internet (and, ar-guably, <br>
off the Internet as well 5 ), Shawn Fanning and crew had simply <br>
put together components that had been developed independently. <br>
The result was spontaneous combustion. Launched in July 1999, <br>
Napster amassed over 10 million users within nine months. After <br>
eighteen months, there were close to 80 million registered users of the <br>
system. 6 Courts quickly shut Napster down, but other services emerged <br>
to take its place. (Kazaa is currently the most popular p2p service. It <br>
boasts over 100 million members.) These services' systems are different <br>
architecturally, though not very different in function: Each enables <br>
users to make content available to any number of other users. With a <br>
p2p system, you can share your favorite songs with your best friend&mdash;<br>
or your 20,000 best friends. <br>
According to a number of estimates, a huge proportion of Ameri-cans <br>
have tasted file-sharing technology. A study by Ipsos-Insight in <br>
September 2002 estimated that 60 million Americans had downloaded <br>
music&mdash;28 percent of Americans older than 12. 7 A survey by the NPD <br>
group quoted in <i>The New York Times </i>estimated that 43 million citizens <br>
used file-sharing networks to exchange content in May 2003. 8 The vast <br>
majority of these are not kids. Whatever the actual figure, a massive <br>
quantity of content is being "taken" on these networks. The ease and <br>
inexpensiveness of file-sharing networks have inspired millions to en-joy <br>
music in a way that they hadn't before. <br>
Some of this enjoying involves copyright infringement. Some of it <br>
does not. And even among the part that is technically copyright in-fringement, <br>
calculating the actual harm to copyright owners is more <br>
complicated than one might think. So consider&mdash;a bit more carefully <br>
than the polarized voices around this debate usually do&mdash;the kinds of <br>
sharing that file sharing enables, and the kinds of harm it entails. <br>

</p><p>
File sharers share different kinds of content. We can divide these <br>
different kinds into four types. <br>
</p><p>
A. There are some who use sharing networks as substitutes for pur-chasing <br>
content. Thus, when a new Madonna CD is released, <br>
rather than buying the CD, these users simply take it. We might <br>
quibble about whether everyone who takes it would actually <br>
have bought it if sharing didn't make it available for free. Most <br>
probably wouldn't have, but clearly there are some who would. <br>
The latter are the target of category A: users who download in-stead <br>
of purchasing. <br>
B. There are some who use sharing networks to sample music before <br>
purchasing it. Thus, a friend sends another friend an MP3 of an <br>
artist he's not heard of. The other friend then buys CDs by that <br>
artist. This is a kind of targeted advertising, quite likely to suc-ceed. <br>
If the friend recommending the album gains nothing from <br>
a bad recommendation, then one could expect that the recom-mendations <br>
will actually be quite good. The net effect of this <br>
sharing could increase the quantity of music purchased. <br>
C. There are many who use sharing networks to get access to copy-righted <br>
content that is no longer sold or that they would not <br>
have purchased because the transaction costs off the Net are too <br>
high. This use of sharing networks is among the most reward-ing <br>
for many. Songs that were part of your childhood but have <br>
long vanished from the marketplace magically appear again on <br>
the network. (One friend told me that when she discovered <br>
Napster, she spent a solid weekend "recalling" old songs. She <br>
was astonished at the range and mix of content that was avail-able.) <br>
For content not sold, this is still technically a violation of <br>
copyright, though because the copyright owner is not selling the <br>
content anymore, the economic harm is zero&mdash;the same harm <br>
that occurs when I sell my collection of 1960s 45-rpm records to <br>
a local collector. <br>

<br>

D. Finally, there are many who use sharing networks to get access <br>
to content that is not copyrighted or that the copyright owner <br>
wants to give away. <br>
</p><p>
How do these different types of sharing balance out? <br>
Let's start with some simple but important points. From the per-spective <br>
of the law, only type D sharing is clearly legal. From the <br>
perspective of economics, only type A sharing is clearly harmful. 9 <br>
Type B sharing is illegal but plainly beneficial. Type C sharing is ille-gal, <br>
yet good for society (since more exposure to music is good) and <br>
harmless to the artist (since the work is not otherwise available). So <br>
how sharing matters on balance is a hard question to answer&mdash;and cer-tainly <br>
much more difficult than the current rhetoric around the issue <br>
suggests. <br>
Whether on balance sharing is harmful depends importantly on <br>
how harmful type A sharing is. Just as Edison complained about Hol-lywood, <br>
composers complained about piano rolls, recording artists <br>
complained about radio, and broadcasters complained about cable TV, <br>
the music industry complains that type A sharing is a kind of "theft" <br>
that is "devastating" the industry. <br>
While the numbers do suggest that sharing is harmful, how harm-ful <br>
is harder to reckon. It has long been the recording industry's prac-tice <br>
to blame technology for any drop in sales. The history of cassette <br>
recording is a good example. As a study by Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; <br>
Young put it, "Rather than exploiting this new, popular technology, the <br>
labels fought it." 10 The labels claimed that every album taped was an <br>
album unsold, and when record sales fell by 11.4 percent in 1981, the <br>
industry claimed that its point was proved. Technology was the prob-lem, <br>
and banning or regulating technology was the answer. <br>
Yet soon thereafter, and before Congress was given an opportunity <br>
to enact regulation, MTV was launched, and the industry had a record <br>
turnaround. "In the end," Cap Gemini concludes, "the 'crisis' ... was <br>
not the fault of the tapers&mdash;who did not [stop after MTV came into <br>

<br>
</p><p>
being]&mdash;but had to a large extent resulted from stagnation in musical <br>
innovation at the major labels." 11 <br>
But just because the industry was wrong before does not mean it is <br>
wrong today. To evaluate the real threat that p2p sharing presents to <br>
the industry in particular, and society in general&mdash;or at least the soci-ety <br>
that inherits the tradition that gave us the film industry, the record <br>
industry, the radio industry, cable TV, and the VCR&mdash;the question is <br>
not simply whether type A sharing is harmful. The question is also <i>how <br>
</i>harmful type A sharing is, and how beneficial the other types of shar-ing <br>
are. <br>
We start to answer this question by focusing on the net harm, from <br>
the standpoint of the industry as a whole, that sharing networks cause. <br>
The "net harm" to the industry as a whole is the amount by which type <br>
A sharing exceeds type B. If the record companies sold more records <br>
through sampling than they lost through substitution, then sharing <br>
networks would actually benefit music companies on balance. They <br>
would therefore have little <i>static </i>reason to resist them. <br>
Could that be true? Could the industry as a whole be gaining be-cause <br>
of file sharing? Odd as that might sound, the data about CD <br>
sales actually suggest it might be close. <br>
In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9 per-cent, <br>
from 882 million to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7 percent. 12 <br>
This confirms a trend over the past few years. The RIAA blames In-ternet <br>
piracy for the trend, though there are many other causes that <br>
could account for this drop. SoundScan, for example, reports a more <br>
than 20 percent drop in the number of CDs released since 1999. That <br>
no doubt accounts for some of the decrease in sales. Rising prices could <br>
account for at least some of the loss. "From 1999 to 2001, the average <br>
price of a CD rose 7.2 percent, from $13.04 to $14.19." 13 Competition <br>
from other forms of media could also account for some of the decline. <br>
As Jane Black of <i>BusinessWeek </i>notes, "The soundtrack to the film <i>High <br>
Fidelity </i>has a list price of $18.98. You could get the whole movie [on <br>
DVD] for $19.99." 14 <br>

<br>

But let's assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD <br>
sales is because of Internet sharing. Here's the rub: In the same period <br>
that the RIAA estimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the RIAA <br>
estimates that 2.1 billion CDs were downloaded for free. Thus, al-though <br>
2.6 times the total number of CDs sold were downloaded for <br>
free, sales revenue fell by just 6.7 percent. <br>
There are too many different things happening at the same time to <br>
explain these numbers definitively, but one conclusion is unavoidable: <br>
The recording industry constantly asks, "What's the difference be-tween <br>
downloading a song and stealing a CD?"&mdash;but their own num-bers <br>
reveal the difference. If I steal a CD, then there is one less CD to <br>
sell. Every taking is a lost sale. But on the basis of the numbers the <br>
RIAA provides, it is absolutely clear that the same is not true of <br>
downloads. If every download were a lost sale&mdash;if every use of Kazaa <br>
"rob[ bed] the author of [his] profit"&mdash;then the industry would have <br>
suffered a 100 percent drop in sales last year, not a 7 percent drop. If 2.6 <br>
times the number of CDs sold were downloaded for free, and yet sales <br>
revenue dropped by just 6.7 percent, then there is a huge difference be-tween <br>
"downloading a song and stealing a CD." <br>
These are the harms&mdash;alleged and perhaps exaggerated but, let's as-sume, <br>
real. What of the benefits? File sharing may impose costs on the <br>
recording industry. What value does it produce in addition to these <br>
costs? <br>
One benefit is type C sharing&mdash;making available content that is <br>
technically still under copyright but is no longer commercially avail-able. <br>
This is not a small category of content. There are millions of <br>
tracks that are no longer commercially available. 15 And while it's con-ceivable <br>
that some of this content is not available because the artist <br>
producing the content doesn't want it to be made available, the vast <br>
majority of it is unavailable solely because the publisher or the distrib-utor <br>
has decided it no longer makes economic sense <i>to the company </i>to <br>
make it available. <br>
In real space&mdash;long before the Internet&mdash;the market had a simple <br>

</p><p>
response to this problem: used book and record stores. There are thou-sands <br>
of used book and used record stores in America today. 16 These <br>
stores buy content from owners, then sell the content they buy. And <br>
under American copyright law, when they buy and sell this content, <br>
<i>even if the content is still under copyright, </i>the copyright owner doesn't get <br>
a dime. Used book and record stores are commercial entities; their <br>
owners make money from the content they sell; but as with cable com-panies <br>
before statutory licensing, they don't have to pay the copyright <br>
owner for the content they sell. <br>
Type C sharing, then, is very much like used book stores or used <br>
record stores. It is different, of course, because the person making the <br>
content available isn't making money from making the content avail-able. <br>
It is also different, of course, because in real space, when I sell a <br>
record, I don't have it anymore, while in cyberspace, when someone <br>
shares my 1949 recording of Bernstein's "Two Love Songs," I still have <br>
it. That difference would matter economically if the owner of the 1949 <br>
copyright were selling the record in competition to my sharing. But <br>
we're talking about the class of content that is not currently commer-cially <br>
available. The Internet is making it available, through coopera-tive <br>
sharing, without competing with the market. <br>
It may well be, all things considered, that it would be better if the <br>
copyright owner got something from this trade. But just because it may <br>
well be better, it doesn't follow that it would be good to ban used book <br>
stores. Or put differently, if you think that type C sharing should be <br>
stopped, do you think that libraries and used book stores should be <br>
shut as well? <br>
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, file-sharing networks enable <br>
type D sharing to occur&mdash;the sharing of content that copyright owners <br>
want to have shared or for which there is no continuing copyright. This <br>
sharing clearly benefits authors and society. Science fiction author <br>
Cory Doctorow, for example, released his first novel, <i>Down and Out in <br>
the Magic Kingdom, </i>both free on-line and in bookstores on the same <br>

day. His (and his publisher's) thinking was that the on-line distribution <br>
would be a great advertisement for the "real" book. People would read <br>
part on-line, and then decide whether they liked the book or not. If <br>
they liked it, they would be more likely to buy it. Doctorow's content is <br>
type D content. If sharing networks enable his work to be spread, then <br>
both he and society are better off. (Actually, much better off: It is a <br>
great book!) <br>
Likewise for work in the public domain: This sharing benefits soci-ety <br>
with no legal harm to authors at all. If efforts to solve the problem <br>
of type A sharing destroy the opportunity for type D sharing, then we <br>
lose something important in order to protect type A content. <br>
The point throughout is this: While the recording industry under-standably <br>
says, "This is how much we've lost," we must also ask, "How <br>
much has society gained from p2p sharing? What are the efficiencies? <br>
What is the content that otherwise would be unavailable?" <br>
For unlike the piracy I described in the first section of this chapter, <br>
much of the "piracy" that file sharing enables is plainly legal and good. <br>
And like the piracy I described in chapter 4, much of this piracy is mo-tivated <br>
by a new way of spreading content caused by changes in the <br>
technology of distribution. Thus, consistent with the tradition that <br>
gave us Hollywood, radio, the recording industry, and cable TV, the <br>
question we should be asking about file sharing is how best to preserve <br>
its benefits while minimizing (to the extent possible) the wrongful harm <br>
it causes artists. The question is one of balance. The law should seek <br>
that balance, and that balance will be found only with time. <br>
"But isn't the war just a war against illegal sharing? Isn't the target <br>
just what you call type A sharing?" <br>
You would think. And we should hope. But so far, it is not. The ef-fect <br>
of the war purportedly on type A sharing alone has been felt far <br>
beyond that one class of sharing. That much is obvious from the Nap-ster <br>
case itself. When Napster told the district court that it had devel-oped <br>
a technology to block the transfer of 99.4 percent of identified <br>

<br>
</p><p>
infringing material, the district court told counsel for Napster 99.4 <br>
percent was not good enough. Napster had to push the infringements <br>
"down to zero." 17 <br>
If 99.4 percent is not good enough, then this is a war on file-sharing <br>
technologies, not a war on copyright infringement. There is no way to <br>
assure that a p2p system is used 100 percent of the time in compliance <br>
with the law, any more than there is a way to assure that 100 percent of <br>
VCRs or 100 percent of Xerox machines or 100 percent of handguns <br>
are used in compliance with the law. Zero tolerance means zero p2p. <br>
The court's ruling means that we as a society must lose the benefits of <br>
p2p, even for the totally legal and beneficial uses they serve, simply to <br>
assure that there are zero copyright infringements caused by p2p. <br>
Zero tolerance has not been our history. It has not produced the <br>
content industry that we know today. The history of American law has <br>
been a process of balance. As new technologies changed the way con-tent <br>
was distributed, the law adjusted, after some time, to the new tech-nology. <br>
In this adjustment, the law sought to ensure the legitimate rights <br>
of creators while protecting innovation. Sometimes this has meant <br>
more rights for creators. Sometimes less. <br>
So, as we've seen, when "mechanical reproduction" threatened the <br>
interests of composers, Congress balanced the rights of composers <br>
against the interests of the recording industry. It granted rights to com-posers, <br>
but also to the recording artists: Composers were to be paid, but <br>
at a price set by Congress. But when radio started broadcasting the <br>
recordings made by these recording artists, and they complained to <br>
Congress that their "creative property" was not being respected (since <br>
the radio station did not have to pay them for the creativity it broad-cast), <br>
Congress rejected their claim. An indirect benefit was enough. <br>
Cable TV followed the pattern of record albums. When the courts <br>
rejected the claim that cable broadcasters had to pay for the content <br>
they rebroadcast, Congress responded by giving broadcasters a right to <br>
compensation, but at a level set by the law. It likewise gave cable com-panies <br>
the right to the content, so long as they paid the statutory price. <br>

<br>

This compromise, like the compromise affecting records and player <br>
pianos, served two important goals&mdash;indeed, the two central goals of <br>
any copyright legislation. First, the law assured that new innovators <br>
would have the freedom to develop new ways to deliver content. Sec-ond, <br>
the law assured that copyright holders would be paid for the con-tent <br>
that was distributed. One fear was that if Congress simply <br>
required cable TV to pay copyright holders whatever they demanded <br>
for their content, then copyright holders associated with broadcasters <br>
would use their power to stifle this new technology, cable. But if Con-gress <br>
had permitted cable to use broadcasters' content for free, then it <br>
would have unfairly subsidized cable. Thus Congress chose a path that <br>
would assure <i>compensation </i>without giving the past (broadcasters) con-trol <br>
over the future (cable). <br>
In the same year that Congress struck this balance, two major pro-ducers <br>
and distributors of film content filed a lawsuit against another <br>
technology, the video tape recorder (VTR, or as we refer to them today, <br>
VCRs) that Sony had produced, the Betamax. Disney's and Universal's <br>
claim against Sony was relatively simple: Sony produced a device, Dis-ney <br>
and Universal claimed, that enabled consumers to engage in copy-right <br>
infringement. Because the device that Sony built had a "record" <br>
button, the device could be used to record copyrighted movies and <br>
shows. Sony was therefore benefiting from the copyright infringement <br>
of its customers. It should therefore, Disney and Universal claimed, be <br>
partially liable for that infringement. <br>
There was something to Disney's and Universal's claim. Sony did <br>
decide to design its machine to make it very simple to record television <br>
shows. It could have built the machine to block or inhibit any direct <br>
copying from a television broadcast. Or possibly, it could have built the <br>
machine to copy only if there were a special "copy me" signal on the <br>
line. It was clear that there were many television shows that did not <br>
grant anyone permission to copy. Indeed, if anyone had asked, no <br>
doubt the majority of shows would not have authorized copying. And <br>
in the face of this obvious preference, Sony could have designed its sys-" <br>

tem to minimize the opportunity for copyright infringement. It did <br>
not, and for that, Disney and Universal wanted to hold it responsible <br>
for the architecture it chose. <br>
MPAA president Jack Valenti became the studios' most vocal <br>
champion. Valenti called VCRs "tapeworms." He warned, "When <br>
there are 20, 30, 40 million of these VCRs in the land, we will be in-vaded <br>
by millions of 'tapeworms, ' eating away at the very heart and <br>
essence of the most precious asset the copyright owner has, his copy-right." 18 <br>
"One does not have to be trained in sophisticated marketing <br>
and creative judgment," he told Congress, "to understand the devasta-tion <br>
on the after-theater marketplace caused by the hundreds of mil-lions <br>
of tapings that will adversely impact on the future of the creative <br>
community in this country. It is simply a question of basic economics <br>
and plain common sense." 19 Indeed, as surveys would later show, 45 <br>
percent of VCR owners had movie libraries of ten videos or more 20 &ndash;a <br>
use the Court would later hold was not "fair." By "allowing VCR own-ers <br>
to copy freely by the means of an exemption from copyright in-fringement <br>
without creating a mechanism to compensate copyright <br>
owners," Valenti testified, Congress would "take from the owners the <br>
very essence of their property: the exclusive right to control who may <br>
use their work, that is, who may copy it and thereby profit from its re-production." 21 <br>
</p><p>
It took eight years for this case to be resolved by the Supreme <br>
Court. In the interim, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which in-cludes <br>
Hollywood in its jurisdiction&mdash;leading Judge Alex Kozinski, <br>
who sits on that court, refers to it as the "Hollywood Circuit"&mdash;held <br>
that Sony would be liable for the copyright infringement made possi-ble <br>
by its machines. Under the Ninth Circuit's rule, this totally famil-iar <br>
technology&mdash;which Jack Valenti had called "the Boston Strangler <br>
of the American film industry" (worse yet, it was a <i>Japanese </i>Boston <br>
Strangler of the American film industry)&mdash;was an illegal technology. 22 <br>
But the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit. <br>

And in its reversal, the Court clearly articulated its understanding of <br>
when and whether courts should intervene in such disputes. As the <br>
Court wrote, <br>
</p><p>
Sound policy, as well as history, supports our consistent deference <br>
to Congress when major technological innovations alter the mar-ket <br>
for copyrighted materials. Congress has the constitutional au-thority <br>
and the institutional ability to accommodate fully the <br>
varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably im-plicated <br>
by such new technology. 23 <br>
</p><p>
Congress was asked to respond to the Supreme Court's decision. <br>
But as with the plea of recording artists about radio broadcasts, Con-gress <br>
ignored the request. Congress was convinced that American film <br>
got enough, this "taking" notwithstanding. <br>
If we put these cases together, a pattern is clear: <br>
</p><p>
<tt>"PIRACY" 77 <br>
</tt><b>CASE WHOSE VALUE RESPONSE OF RESPONSE OF CONGRESS <br>
WAS "PIRATED" THE COURTS <br>
</b></p><p>
Recordings Composers No protection Statutory license <br>
Radio Recording artists N/ A Nothing <br>
Cable TV Broadcasters No protection Statutory license <br>
VCR Film creators No protection Nothing <br>
</p><p>
In each case throughout our history, a new technology changed the <br>
way content was distributed. 24 In each case, throughout our history, <br>
that change meant that someone got a "free ride" on someone else's <br>
work. <br>
In <i>none </i>of these cases did either the courts or Congress eliminate all <br>
free riding. In <i>none </i>of these cases did the courts or Congress insist that <br>
the law should assure that the copyright holder get all the value that his <br>
copyright created. In every case, the copyright owners complained of <br>
"piracy." In every case, Congress acted to recognize some of the legiti-

<br>
</p><p>
macy in the behavior of the "pirates." In each case, Congress allowed <br>
some new technology to benefit from content made before. It balanced <br>
the interests at stake. <br>
When you think across these examples, and the other examples that <br>
make up the first four chapters of this section, this balance makes <br>
sense. Was Walt Disney a pirate? Would doujinshi be better if creators <br>
had to ask permission? Should tools that enable others to capture and <br>
spread images as a way to cultivate or criticize our culture be better reg-ulated? <br>
Is it really right that building a search engine should expose you <br>
to $15 million in damages? Would it have been better if Edison had <br>
controlled film? Should every cover band have to hire a lawyer to get <br>
permission to record a song? <br>
We could answer yes to each of these questions, but our tradition <br>
has answered no. In our tradition, as the Supreme Court has stated, <br>
copyright "has never accorded the copyright owner complete control <br>
over all possible uses of his work." 25 Instead, the particular uses that the <br>
law regulates have been defined by balancing the good that comes from <br>
granting an exclusive right against the burdens such an exclusive right <br>
creates. And this balancing has historically been done <i>after </i>a technol-ogy <br>
has matured, or settled into the mix of technologies that facilitate <br>
the distribution of content. <br>
We should be doing the same thing today. The technology of the <br>
Internet is changing quickly. The way people connect to the Internet <br>
(wires vs. wireless) is changing very quickly. No doubt the network <br>
should not become a tool for "stealing" from artists. But neither should <br>
the law become a tool to entrench one particular way in which artists <br>
(or more accurately, distributors) get paid. As I describe in some detail <br>
in the last chapter of this book, we should be securing income to artists <br>
while we allow the market to secure the most efficient way to promote <br>
and distribute content. This will require changes in the law, at least <br>
in the interim. These changes should be designed to balance the pro-tection <br>
of the law against the strong public interest that innovation <br>
continue. <br>

This is especially true when a new technology enables a vastly su-perior <br>

can be ideally efficient in moving content across a widely diverse net-work. <br>
Left to develop, they could make the network vastly more effi-cient. <br>

to 'rebalance' our property rights? Do you have to wait before calling <br>
the police when your car has been stolen? And why should Congress <br>
deliberate at all about the merits of this theft? Do we ask whether the <br>
car thief had a good use for the car before we arrest him?" <br>
"It is <i>our property," </i>the warriors insist. "And it should be protected <br>
just as any other property is protected." <br>

<tt>The copyright warriors </tt>are right: A copyright is a kind of <br>
property. It can be owned and sold, and the law protects against its <br>
theft. Ordinarily, the copyright owner gets to hold out for any price he <br>
wants. Markets reckon the supply and demand that partially determine <br>
the price she can get. <br>
But in ordinary language, to call a copyright a "property" right is a <br>
bit misleading, for the property of copyright is an odd kind of property. <br>
Indeed, the very idea of property in any idea or any expression is very <br>
odd. I understand what I am taking when I take the picnic table you <br>
put in your backyard. I am taking a thing, the picnic table, and after I <br>
take it, you don't have it. But what am I taking when I take the good <br>
<i>idea </i>you had to put a picnic table in the backyard&mdash;by, for example, go-ing <br>
to Sears, buying a table, and putting it in my backyard? What is the <br>
thing I am taking then? <br>

ideas, though that's an important difference. The point instead is that <br>

take anything from you when I copy the way you dress&mdash;though I <br>
might seem weird if I did it every day, and especially weird if you are a <br>

The exceptions to free use are ideas and expressions within the <br>
reach of the law of patent and copyright, and a few other domains that <br>
I won't discuss here. Here the law says you can't take my idea or ex-pression <br>
without my permission: The law turns the intangible into <br>
property. <br>
But how, and to what extent, and in what form&mdash;the details, in <br>

the intangible into property emerged, we need to place this "prop-erty" <br>

its limits? How does it function in practice? After these stories, the <br>

<tt>CHAPTER SIX: Founders <br>
William Shakespeare </tt>wrote <i>Romeo and Juliet </i>in 1595. The play <br>
was first published in 1597. It was the eleventh major play that Shake-speare <br>
had written. He would continue to write plays through 1613, <br>
and the plays that he wrote have continued to define Anglo-American <br>
culture ever since. So deeply have the works of a sixteenth-century writer <br>
seeped into our culture that we often don't even recognize their source. <br>
I once overheard someone commenting on Kenneth Branagh's adapta-tion <br>
of Henry V: "I liked it, but Shakespeare is so full of clichés." <br>
In 1774, almost 180 years after <i>Romeo and Juliet </i>was written, the <br>
"copy-right" for the work was still thought by many to be the exclusive <br>
right of a single London publisher, Jacob Tonson. 1 Tonson was the <br>
most prominent of a small group of publishers called the Conger 2 who <br>
controlled bookselling in England during the eighteenth century. The <br>
Conger claimed a perpetual right to control the "copy" of books that <br>
they had acquired from authors. That perpetual right meant that no <br>
one else could publish copies of a book to which they held the copy-85

<br>
</p><p>
right. Prices of the classics were thus kept high; competition to pro-duce <br>
better or cheaper editions was eliminated. <br>
Now, there's something puzzling about the year 1774 to anyone who <br>
knows a little about copyright law. The better-known year in the history <br>
of copyright is 1710, the year that the British Parliament adopted the <br>
first "copyright" act. Known as the Statute of Anne, the act stated that <br>
all published works would get a copyright term of fourteen years, re-newable <br>
once if the author was alive, and that all works already pub-lished <br>
by 1710 would get a single term of twenty-one additional years. 3 <br>
Under this law, <i>Romeo and Juliet </i>should have been free in 1731. So why <br>
was there any issue about it still being under Tonson's control in 1774? <br>
The reason is that the English hadn't yet agreed on what a "copy-right" <br>
was&mdash;indeed, no one had. At the time the English passed the <br>
Statute of Anne, there was no other legislation governing copyrights. <br>
The last law regulating publishers, the Licensing Act of 1662, had ex-pired <br>
in 1695. That law gave publishers a monopoly over publishing, as <br>
a way to make it easier for the Crown to control what was published. <br>
But after it expired, there was no positive law that said that the pub-lishers, <br>
or "Stationers," had an exclusive right to print books. <br>
There was no <i>positive </i>law, but that didn't mean that there was no <br>
law. The Anglo-American legal tradition looks to both the words of <br>
legislatures and the words of judges to know the rules that are to gov-ern <br>
how people are to behave. We call the words from legislatures "pos-itive <br>
law." We call the words from judges "common law." The common <br>
law sets the background against which legislatures legislate; the legis-lature, <br>
ordinarily, can trump that background only if it passes a law to <br>
displace it. And so the real question after the licensing statutes had ex-pired <br>
was whether the common law protected a copyright, indepen-dent <br>
of any positive law. <br>
This question was important to the publishers, or "booksellers," as <br>
they were called, because there was growing competition from foreign <br>
publishers. The Scottish, in particular, were increasingly publishing <br>
and exporting books to England. That competition reduced the profits <br>

<br>

of the Conger, which reacted by demanding that Parliament pass a law <br>
to again give them exclusive control over publishing. That demand ul-timately <br>
resulted in the Statute of Anne. <br>
The Statute of Anne granted the author or "proprietor" of a book <br>
an exclusive right to print that book. In an important limitation, how-ever, <br>
and to the horror of the booksellers, the law gave the bookseller <br>
that right for a limited term. At the end of that term, the copyright "ex-pired," <br>
and the work would then be free and could be published by <br>
anyone. Or so the legislature is thought to have believed. <br>
Now, the thing to puzzle about for a moment is this: Why would <br>
Parliament limit the exclusive right? Not why would they limit it to the <br>
particular limit they set, but why would they limit the right <i>at all? <br>
</i>For the booksellers, and the authors whom they represented, had a <br>
very strong claim. Take <i>Romeo and Juliet </i>as an example: That play was <br>
written by Shakespeare. It was his genius that brought it into the <br>
world. He didn't take anybody's property when he created this play <br>
(that's a controversial claim, but never mind), and by his creating this <br>
play, he didn't make it any harder for others to craft a play. So why is it <br>
that the law would ever allow someone else to come along and take <br>
Shakespeare's play without his, or his estate's, permission? What rea-son <br>
is there to allow someone else to "steal" Shakespeare's work? <br>
The answer comes in two parts. We first need to see something spe-cial <br>
about the notion of "copyright" that existed at the time of the <br>
Statute of Anne. Second, we have to see something important about <br>
"booksellers." <br>
First, about copyright. In the last three hundred years, we have <br>
come to apply the concept of "copyright" ever more broadly. But in <br>
1710, it wasn't so much a concept as it was a very particular right. The <br>
copyright was born as a very specific set of restrictions: It forbade oth-ers <br>
from reprinting a book. In 1710, the "copy-right" was a right to use <br>
a particular machine to replicate a particular work. It did not go be-yond <br>
that very narrow right. It did not control any more generally how <br>
a work could be <i>used. </i>Today the right includes a large collection of re-" <br>
</p><p>
<tt>PROPERTY" 87 </tt>

<br>
</p><p>
strictions on the freedom of others: It grants the author the exclusive <br>
right to copy, the exclusive right to distribute, the exclusive right to <br>
perform, and so on. <br>
So, for example, even if the copyright to Shakespeare's works were <br>
perpetual, all that would have meant under the original meaning of the <br>
term was that no one could reprint Shakespeare's work without the per-mission <br>
of the Shakespeare estate. It would not have controlled any-thing, <br>
for example, about how the work could be performed, whether <br>
the work could be translated, or whether Kenneth Branagh would be <br>
allowed to make his films. The "copy-right" was only an exclusive right <br>
to print&mdash;no less, of course, but also no more. <br>
Even that limited right was viewed with skepticism by the British. <br>
They had had a long and ugly experience with "exclusive rights," espe-cially <br>
"exclusive rights" granted by the Crown. The English had fought <br>
a civil war in part about the Crown's practice of handing out monopo-lies&mdash;<br>
especially monopolies for works that already existed. King Henry <br>
VIII granted a patent to print the Bible and a monopoly to Darcy to <br>
print playing cards. The English Parliament began to fight back <br>
against this power of the Crown. In 1656, it passed the Statute of Mo-nopolies, <br>
limiting monopolies to patents for new inventions. And by <br>
1710, Parliament was eager to deal with the growing monopoly in <br>
publishing. <br>
Thus the "copy-right," when viewed as a monopoly right, was nat-urally <br>
viewed as a right that should be limited. (However convincing <br>
the claim that "it's my property, and I should have it forever," try <br>
sounding convincing when uttering, "It's my monopoly, and I should <br>
have it forever.") The state would protect the exclusive right, but only <br>
so long as it benefited society. The British saw the harms from special-interest <br>
favors; they passed a law to stop them. <br>
Second, about booksellers. It wasn't just that the copyright was a <br>
monopoly. It was also that it was a monopoly held by the booksellers. <br>
Booksellers sound quaint and harmless to us. They were not viewed <br>
as harmless in seventeenth-century England. Members of the Conger <br>

<br>

were increasingly seen as monopolists of the worst kind&mdash;tools of the <br>
Crown's repression, selling the liberty of England to guarantee them-selves <br>
a monopoly profit. The attacks against these monopolists were <br>
harsh: Milton described them as "old patentees and monopolizers in <br>
the trade of book-selling"; they were "men who do not therefore labour <br>
in an honest profession to which learning is indetted." 4 <br>
Many believed the power the booksellers exercised over the spread <br>
of knowledge was harming that spread, just at the time the Enlighten-ment <br>
was teaching the importance of education and knowledge spread <br>
generally. The idea that knowledge should be free was a hallmark of the <br>
time, and these powerful commercial interests were interfering with <br>
that idea. <br>
To balance this power, Parliament decided to increase competition <br>
among booksellers, and the simplest way to do that was to spread the <br>
wealth of valuable books. Parliament therefore limited the term of <br>
copyrights, and thereby guaranteed that valuable books would become <br>
open to any publisher to publish after a limited time. Thus the setting <br>
of the term for existing works to just twenty-one years was a compro-mise <br>
to fight the power of the booksellers. The limitation on terms was <br>
an indirect way to assure competition among publishers, and thus the <br>
construction and spread of culture. <br>
When 1731 (1710 + 21) came along, however, the booksellers were <br>
getting anxious. They saw the consequences of more competition, and <br>
like every competitor, they didn't like them. At first booksellers simply <br>
ignored the Statute of Anne, continuing to insist on the perpetual right <br>
to control publication. But in 1735 and 1737, they tried to persuade <br>
Parliament to extend their terms. Twenty-one years was not enough, <br>
they said; they needed more time. <br>
Parliament rejected their requests. As one pamphleteer put it, in <br>
words that echo today, <br>

ones Expire; so that should this Bill pass, it will in Effect be es-tablishing <br>
a perpetual Monopoly, a Thing deservedly odious in <br>
the Eye of the Law; it will be a great Cramp to Trade, a Discour-agement <br>
to Learning, no Benefit to the Authors, but a general <br>
Tax on the Publick; and all this only to increase the private Gain <br>
of the Booksellers. 5 <br>
</p><p>
Having failed in Parliament, the publishers turned to the courts in <br>
a series of cases. Their argument was simple and direct: The Statute of <br>
Anne gave authors certain protections through positive law, but those <br>
protections were not intended as replacements for the common law. <br>
Instead, they were intended simply to supplement the common law. <br>
Under common law, it was already wrong to take another person's cre-ative <br>
"property" and use it without his permission. The Statute of Anne, <br>
the booksellers argued, didn't change that. Therefore, just because the <br>
protections of the Statute of Anne expired, that didn't mean the pro-tections <br>
of the common law expired: Under the common law they had <br>
the right to ban the publication of a book, even if its Statute of Anne <br>
copyright had expired. This, they argued, was the only way to protect <br>
authors. <br>
This was a clever argument, and one that had the support of some <br>
of the leading jurists of the day. It also displayed extraordinary chutz-pah. <br>
Until then, as law professor Raymond Patterson has put it, "The <br>
publishers ... had as much concern for authors as a cattle rancher has <br>
for cattle." 6 The bookseller didn't care squat for the rights of the au-thor. <br>
His concern was the monopoly profit that the author's work gave. <br>
The booksellers' argument was not accepted without a fight. <br>
The hero of this fight was a Scottish bookseller named Alexander <br>
Donaldson. 7 <br>
Donaldson was an outsider to the London Conger. He began his <br>
career in Edinburgh in 1750. The focus of his business was inexpensive <br>
reprints "of standard works whose copyright term had expired," at least <br>
under the Statute of Anne. 8 Donaldson's publishing house prospered <br>

<br>

and became "something of a center for literary Scotsmen." "[ A] mong <br>
them," Professor Mark Rose writes, was "the young James Boswell <br>
who, together with his friend Andrew Erskine, published an anthology <br>
of contemporary Scottish poems with Donaldson." 9 <br>
When the London booksellers tried to shut down Donaldson's <br>
shop in Scotland, he responded by moving his shop to London, where <br>
he sold inexpensive editions "of the most popular English books, in de-fiance <br>
of the supposed common law right of Literary Property." 10 His <br>
books undercut the Conger prices by 30 to 50 percent, and he rested <br>
his right to compete upon the ground that, under the Statute of Anne, <br>
the works he was selling had passed out of protection. <br>
The London booksellers quickly brought suit to block "piracy" like <br>
Donaldson's. A number of actions were successful against the "pirates," <br>
the most important early victory being <i>Millar </i>v. <i>Taylor. <br>
</i>Millar was a bookseller who in 1729 had purchased the rights to <br>
James Thomson's poem "The Seasons." Millar complied with the re-quirements <br>
of the Statute of Anne, and therefore received the full pro-tection <br>
of the statute. After the term of copyright ended, Robert Taylor <br>
began printing a competing volume. Millar sued, claiming a perpetual <br>
common law right, the Statute of Anne notwithstanding. 11 <br>
Astonishingly to modern lawyers, one of the greatest judges in En-glish <br>
history, Lord Mansfield, agreed with the booksellers. Whatever <br>
protection the Statute of Anne gave booksellers, it did not, he held, <br>
extinguish any common law right. The question was whether the <br>
common law would protect the author against subsequent "pirates." <br>
Mansfield's answer was yes: The common law would bar Taylor from <br>
reprinting Thomson's poem without Millar's permission. That com-mon <br>
law rule thus effectively gave the booksellers a perpetual right to <br>
control the publication of any book assigned to them. <br>
Considered as a matter of abstract justice&mdash;reasoning as if justice <br>
were just a matter of logical deduction from first principles&mdash;Mansfield's <br>
conclusion might make some sense. But what it ignored was the larger <br>
issue that Parliament had struggled with in 1710: How best to limit <br>

</p><p>
the monopoly power of publishers? Parliament's strategy was to offer a <br>
term for existing works that was long enough to buy peace in 1710, but <br>
short enough to assure that culture would pass into competition within <br>
a reasonable period of time. Within twenty-one years, Parliament be-lieved, <br>
Britain would mature from the controlled culture that the <br>
Crown coveted to the free culture that we inherited. <br>
The fight to defend the limits of the Statute of Anne was not to end <br>
there, however, and it is here that Donaldson enters the mix. <br>
Millar died soon after his victory, so his case was not appealed. His <br>
estate sold Thomson's poems to a syndicate of printers that included <br>
Thomas Beckett. 12 Donaldson then released an unauthorized edition <br>
of Thomson's works. Beckett, on the strength of the decision in <i>Millar, <br>
</i>got an injunction against Donaldson. Donaldson appealed the case to <br>
the House of Lords, which functioned much like our own Supreme <br>
Court. In February of 1774, that body had the chance to interpret the <br>
meaning of Parliament's limits from sixty years before. <br>
As few legal cases ever do, <i>Donaldson </i>v. <i>Beckett </i>drew an enormous <br>
amount of attention throughout Britain. Donaldson's lawyers argued <br>
that whatever rights may have existed under the common law, the Statute <br>
of Anne terminated those rights. After passage of the Statute of Anne, <br>
the only legal protection for an exclusive right to control publication <br>
came from that statute. Thus, they argued, after the term specified in <br>
the Statute of Anne expired, works that had been protected by the <br>
statute were no longer protected. <br>
The House of Lords was an odd institution. Legal questions were <br>
presented to the House and voted upon first by the "law lords," mem-bers <br>
of special legal distinction who functioned much like the Justices <br>
in our Supreme Court. Then, after the law lords voted, the House of <br>
Lords generally voted. <br>
The reports about the law lords' votes are mixed. On some counts, <br>
it looks as if perpetual copyright prevailed. But there is no ambiguity <br>
about how the House of Lords voted as whole. By a two-to-one ma-92 <br>

jority (22 to 11) they voted to reject the idea of perpetual copyrights. <br>
Whatever one's understanding of the common law, now a copyright <br>
was fixed for a limited time, after which the work protected by copy-right <br>
passed into the public domain. <br>
"The public domain." Before the case of <i>Donaldson </i>v. <i>Beckett, </i>there <br>
was no clear idea of a public domain in England. Before 1774, there <br>
was a strong argument that common law copyrights were perpetual. <br>
After 1774, the public domain was born. For the first time in Anglo-American <br>
history, the legal control over creative works expired, and the <br>
greatest works in English history&mdash;including those of Shakespeare, <br>
Bacon, Milton, Johnson, and Bunyan&mdash;were free of legal restraint. <br>
It is hard for us to imagine, but this decision by the House of Lords <br>
fueled an extraordinarily popular and political reaction. In Scotland, <br>
where most of the "pirate publishers" did their work, people celebrated <br>
the decision in the streets. As the <i>Edinburgh Advertiser </i>reported, "No <br>
private cause has so much engrossed the attention of the public, and <br>
none has been tried before the House of Lords in the decision of <br>
which so many individuals were interested." "Great rejoicing in Edin-burgh <br>
upon victory over literary property: bonfires and illumina-tions." 13 <br>
</p><p>
In London, however, at least among publishers, the reaction was <br>
equally strong in the opposite direction. The <i>Morning Chronicle </i>re-ported: <br>
</p><p>
By the above decision ... near 200,000 pounds worth of what <br>
was honestly purchased at public sale, and which was yesterday <br>
thought property is now reduced to nothing. The Booksellers of <br>
London and Westminster, many of whom sold estates and houses <br>
to purchase Copy-right, are in a manner ruined, and those who <br>
after many years industry thought they had acquired a compe-tency <br>
to provide for their families now find themselves without a <br>
shilling to devise to their successors. 14 <br>

"Ruined" is a bit of an exaggeration. But it is not an exaggeration to <br>
say that the change was profound. The decision of the House of Lords <br>
meant that the booksellers could no longer control how culture in En-gland <br>
would grow and develop. Culture in England was thereafter <i>free. <br>
</i>Not in the sense that copyrights would not be respected, for of course, <br>
for a limited time after a work was published, the bookseller had an ex-clusive <br>
right to control the publication of that book. And not in the <br>
sense that books could be stolen, for even after a copyright expired, you <br>
still had to buy the book from someone. But <i>free </i>in the sense that the <br>
culture and its growth would no longer be controlled by a small group <br>
of publishers. As every free market does, this free market of free culture <br>
would grow as the consumers and producers chose. English culture <br>
would develop as the many English readers chose to let it develop&mdash;<br>
chose in the books they bought and wrote; chose in the memes they <br>
repeated and endorsed. Chose in a <i>competitive context, </i>not a context <br>
in which the choices about what culture is available to people and <br>
how they get access to it are made by the few despite the wishes of <br>
the many. <br>
At least, this was the rule in a world where the Parliament is anti-monopoly, <br>
resistant to the protectionist pleas of publishers. In a world <br>
where the Parliament is more pliant, free culture would be less pro-tected. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER SEVEN: Recorders <br>
Jon Else </tt>is a filmmaker. He is best known for his documentaries and <br>
has been very successful in spreading his art. He is also a teacher, and <br>
as a teacher myself, I envy the loyalty and admiration that his students <br>
feel for him. (I met, by accident, two of his students at a dinner party. <br>
He was their god.) <br>
Else worked on a documentary that I was involved in. At a break, <br>
he told me a story about the freedom to create with film in America <br>
today. <br>
In 1990, Else was working on a documentary about Wagner's Ring <br>
Cycle. The focus was stagehands at the San Francisco Opera. Stage-hands <br>
are a particularly funny and colorful element of an opera. Dur-ing <br>
a show, they hang out below the stage in the grips' lounge and in <br>
the lighting loft. They make a perfect contrast to the art on the stage. <br>
During one of the performances, Else was shooting some stage-hands <br>
playing checkers. In one corner of the room was a television set. <br>
Playing on the television set, while the stagehands played checkers and <br>
the opera company played Wagner, was <i>The Simpsons. </i>As Else judged <br>

</p><p>
it, this touch of cartoon helped capture the flavor of what was special <br>
about the scene. <br>
Years later, when he finally got funding to complete the film, Else <br>
attempted to clear the rights for those few seconds of <i>The Simpsons. <br>
</i>For of course, those few seconds are copyrighted; and of course, to use <br>
copyrighted material you need the permission of the copyright owner, <br>
unless "fair use" or some other privilege applies. <br>
Else called <i>Simpsons </i>creator Matt Groening's office to get permis-sion. <br>
Groening approved the shot. The shot was a four-and-a-half-second <br>
image on a tiny television set in the corner of the room. How <br>
could it hurt? Groening was happy to have it in the film, but he told <br>
Else to contact Gracie Films, the company that produces the program. <br>
Gracie Films was okay with it, too, but they, like Groening, wanted <br>
to be careful. So they told Else to contact Fox, Gracie's parent company. <br>
Else called Fox and told them about the clip in the corner of the one <br>
room shot of the film. Matt Groening had already given permission, <br>
Else said. He was just confirming the permission with Fox. <br>
Then, as Else told me, "two things happened. First we discov-ered <br>
. . . that Matt Groening doesn't own his own creation&mdash;or at least <br>
that someone [at Fox] believes he doesn't own his own creation." And <br>
second, Fox "wanted ten thousand dollars as a licensing fee for us to use <br>
this four-point-five seconds of ... entirely unsolicited <i>Simpsons </i>which <br>
was in the corner of the shot." <br>
Else was certain there was a mistake. He worked his way up to <br>
someone he thought was a vice president for licensing, Rebecca Her-rera. <br>
He explained to her, "There must be some mistake here. . . . <br>
We're asking for your educational rate on this." That was the educa-tional <br>
rate, Herrera told Else. A day or so later, Else called again to <br>
confirm what he had been told. <br>
"I wanted to make sure I had my facts straight," he told me. "Yes, <br>
you have your facts straight," she said. It would cost $10,000 to use the <br>
clip of <i>The Simpsons </i>in the corner of a shot in a documentary film about <br>

Wagner's Ring Cycle. And then, astonishingly, Herrera told Else, "And <br>
if you quote me, I'll turn you over to our attorneys." As an assistant to <br>
Herrera told Else later on, "They don't give a shit. They just want the <br>
money." <br>
Else didn't have the money to buy the right to replay what was play-ing <br>
on the television backstage at the San Francisco Opera. To reproduce <br>
this reality was beyond the documentary filmmaker's budget. At the very <br>
last minute before the film was to be released, Else digitally replaced the <br>
shot with a clip from another film that he had worked on, <i>The Day After <br>
Trinity, </i>from ten years before. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>There's no doubt </tt>that someone, whether Matt Groening or Fox, <br>
owns the copyright to <i>The Simpsons. </i>That copyright is their property. <br>
To use that copyrighted material thus sometimes requires the permis-sion <br>
of the copyright owner. If the use that Else wanted to make of the <br>
<i>Simpsons </i>copyright were one of the uses restricted by the law, then he <br>
would need to get the permission of the copyright owner before he <br>
could use the work in that way. And in a free market, it is the owner of <br>
the copyright who gets to set the price for any use that the law says the <br>
owner gets to control. <br>
For example, "public performance" is a use of <i>The Simpsons </i>that <br>
the copyright owner gets to control. If you take a selection of favorite <br>
episodes, rent a movie theater, and charge for tickets to come see "My <br>
Favorite <i>Simpsons," </i>then you need to get permission from the copy-right <br>
owner. And the copyright owner (rightly, in my view) can charge <br>
whatever she wants&ndash;$ 10 or $1,000,000. That's her right, as set by <br>
the law. <br>
But when lawyers hear this story about Jon Else and Fox, their first <br>
thought is "fair use." 1 Else's use of just 4.5 seconds of an indirect shot <br>
of a <i>Simpsons </i>episode is clearly a fair use of <i>The Simpsons&mdash;</i>and fair use <br>
does not require the permission of anyone. <br>

<a href="#page111">111</a>
<br>
</p><p>
So I asked Else why he didn't just rely upon "fair use." Here's his reply: <br>
The <i>Simpsons </i>fiasco was for me a great lesson in the gulf be-tween <br>
what lawyers find irrelevant in some abstract sense, and <br>
what is crushingly relevant in practice to those of us actually <br>
trying to make and broadcast documentaries. I never had any <br>
doubt that it was "clearly fair use" in an absolute legal sense. But <br>
I couldn't rely on the concept in any concrete way. Here's why: <br>
</p><p>
1. Before our films can be broadcast, the network requires <br>
that we buy Errors and Omissions insurance. The carriers re-quire <br>
a detailed "visual cue sheet" listing the source and licens-ing <br>
status of each shot in the film. They take a dim view of <br>
"fair use," and a claim of "fair use" can grind the application <br>
process to a halt. <br>
</p><p>
2. I probably never should have asked Matt Groening in the <br>
first place. But I knew (at least from folklore) that Fox had a <br>
history of tracking down and stopping unlicensed <i>Simpsons <br>
</i>usage, just as George Lucas had a very high profile litigating <br>
<i>Star Wars </i>usage. So I decided to play by the book, thinking <br>
that we would be granted free or cheap license to four seconds <br>
of <i>Simpsons. </i>As a documentary producer working to exhaus-tion <br>
on a shoestring, the last thing I wanted was to risk legal <br>
trouble, even nuisance legal trouble, and even to defend a <br>
principle. <br>
</p><p>
3. I did, in fact, speak with one of your colleagues at Stanford <br>
Law School ... who confirmed that it was fair use. He also <br>
confirmed that Fox would "depose and litigate you to within <br>
an inch of your life," regardless of the merits of my claim. He <br>
made clear that it would boil down to who had the bigger le-gal <br>
department and the deeper pockets, me or them. <br>

<br>

4. The question of fair use usually comes up at the end of the <br>
project, when we are up against a release deadline and out of <br>
money. <br>
</p><p>
In theory, fair use means you need no permission. The theory there-fore <br>
supports free culture and insulates against a permission culture. <br>
But in practice, fair use functions very differently. The fuzzy lines of <br>
the law, tied to the extraordinary liability if lines are crossed, means <br>
that the effective fair use for many types of creators is slight. The law <br>
has the right aim; practice has defeated the aim. <br>
This practice shows just how far the law has come from its <br>
eighteenth-century roots. The law was born as a shield to protect pub-lishers' <br>
profits against the unfair competition of a pirate. It has matured <br>
into a sword that interferes with any use, transformative or not. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER EIGHT: Transformers <br>
In 1993, </tt>Alex Alben was a lawyer working at Starwave, Inc. Star-wave <br>
was an innovative company founded by Microsoft cofounder <br>
Paul Allen to develop digital entertainment. Long before the Internet <br>
became popular, Starwave began investing in new technology for de-livering <br>
entertainment in anticipation of the power of networks. <br>
Alben had a special interest in new technology. He was intrigued by <br>
the emerging market for CD-ROM technology&mdash;not to distribute <br>
film, but to do things with film that otherwise would be very difficult. <br>
In 1993, he launched an initiative to develop a product to build retro-spectives <br>
on the work of particular actors. The first actor chosen was <br>
Clint Eastwood. The idea was to showcase all of the work of East-wood, <br>
with clips from his films and interviews with figures important <br>
to his career. <br>
At that time, Eastwood had made more than fifty films, as an actor <br>
and as a director. Alben began with a series of interviews with East-wood, <br>
asking him about his career. Because Starwave produced those <br>
interviews, it was free to include them on the CD. <br>

<a href="#page114">114</a>
<br>

That alone would not have made a very interesting product, so <br>
Starwave wanted to add content from the movies in Eastwood's career: <br>
posters, scripts, and other material relating to the films Eastwood <br>
made. Most of his career was spent at Warner Brothers, and so it was <br>
relatively easy to get permission for that content. <br>
Then Alben and his team decided to include actual film clips. "Our <br>
goal was that we were going to have a clip from every one of East-wood's <br>
films," Alben told me. It was here that the problem arose. "No <br>
one had ever really done this before," Alben explained. "No one had <br>
ever tried to do this in the context of an artistic look at an actor's <br>
career." <br>
Alben brought the idea to Michael Slade, the CEO of Starwave. <br>
Slade asked, "Well, what will it take?" <br>
Alben replied, "Well, we're going to have to clear rights from <br>
everyone who appears in these films, and the music and everything <br>
else that we want to use in these film clips." Slade said, "Great! Go <br>
for it." 1 <br>
The problem was that neither Alben nor Slade had any idea what <br>
clearing those rights would mean. Every actor in each of the films <br>
could have a claim to royalties for the reuse of that film. But CD-ROMs <br>
had not been specified in the contracts for the actors, so there <br>
was no clear way to know just what Starwave was to do. <br>
I asked Alben how he dealt with the problem. With an obvious <br>
pride in his resourcefulness that obscured the obvious bizarreness of his <br>
tale, Alben recounted just what they did: <br>
</p><p>
So we very mechanically went about looking up the film clips. <br>
We made some artistic decisions about what film clips to in-clude&mdash;<br>
of course we were going to use the "Make my day" clip <br>
from <i>Dirty Harry. </i>But you then need to get the guy on the ground <br>
who's wiggling under the gun and you need to get his permis-sion. <br>
And then you have to decide what you are going to pay <br>
him. <br>

<strong><a name="page114"> Page 114</a></strong>
<a href="#page115">115</a>
<br>
</p><p>
We decided that it would be fair if we offered them the day-player <br>
rate for the right to reuse that performance. We're talking <br>
about a clip of less than a minute, but to reuse that performance <br>
in the CD-ROM the rate at the time was about $600. <br>
So we had to identify the people&mdash;some of them were hard to <br>
identify because in Eastwood movies you can't tell who's the guy <br>
crashing through the glass&mdash;is it the actor or is it the stuntman? <br>
And then we just, we put together a team, my assistant and some <br>
others, and we just started calling people. <br>
</p><p>
Some actors were glad to help&mdash;Donald Sutherland, for example, <br>
followed up himself to be sure that the rights had been cleared. <br>
Others were dumbfounded at their good fortune. Alben would ask, <br>
"Hey, can I pay you $600 or maybe if you were in two films, you <br>
know, $1,200?" And they would say, "Are you for real? Hey, I'd love <br>
to get $1,200." And some of course were a bit difficult (estranged <br>
ex-wives, in particular). But eventually, Alben and his team had <br>
cleared the rights to this retrospective CD-ROM on Clint Eastwood's <br>
career. <br>
It was one <i>year </i>later&ndash;" and even then we weren't sure whether we <br>
were totally in the clear." <br>
Alben is proud of his work. The project was the first of its kind and <br>
the only time he knew of that a team had undertaken such a massive <br>
project for the purpose of releasing a retrospective. <br>
</p><p>
Everyone thought it would be too hard. Everyone just threw up <br>
their hands and said, "Oh, my gosh, a film, it's so many copy-rights, <br>
there's the music, there's the screenplay, there's the director, <br>
there's the actors." But we just broke it down. We just put it into <br>
its constituent parts and said, "Okay, there's this many actors, this <br>
many directors, ... this many musicians," and we just went at it <br>
very systematically and cleared the rights. <br>

<br>

And no doubt, the product itself was exceptionally good. Eastwood <br>
loved it, and it sold very well. <br>
But I pressed Alben about how weird it seems that it would have to <br>
take a year's work simply to clear rights. No doubt Alben had done this <br>
efficiently, but as Peter Drucker has famously quipped, "There is noth-ing <br>
so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at <br>
all." 2 Did it make sense, I asked Alben, that this is the way a new work <br>
has to be made? <br>
For, as he acknowledged, "very few ... have the time and resources, <br>
and the will to do this," and thus, very few such works would ever be <br>
made. Does it make sense, I asked him, from the standpoint of what <br>
anybody really thought they were ever giving rights for originally, that <br>
you would have to go clear rights for these kinds of clips? <br>
</p><p>
I don't think so. When an actor renders a performance in a movie, <br>
he or she gets paid very well. ... And then when 30 seconds of <br>
that performance is used in a new product that is a retrospective <br>
of somebody's career, I don't think that that person ... should be <br>
compensated for that. <br>
</p><p>
Or at least, is this <i>how </i>the artist should be compensated? Would it <br>
make sense, I asked, for there to be some kind of statutory license that <br>
someone could pay and be free to make derivative use of clips like this? <br>
Did it really make sense that a follow-on creator would have to track <br>
down every artist, actor, director, musician, and get explicit permission <br>
from each? Wouldn't a lot more be created if the legal part of the cre-ative <br>
process could be made to be more clean? <br>
</p><p>
Absolutely. I think that if there were some fair-licensing mecha-nism&mdash;<br>
where you weren't subject to hold-ups and you weren't <br>
subject to estranged former spouses&mdash;you'd see a lot more of this <br>
work, because it wouldn't be so daunting to try to put together a <br>

retrospective of someone's career and meaningfully illustrate it <br>
with lots of media from that person's career. You'd build in a cost <br>
as the producer of one of these things. You'd build in a cost of pay-ing <br>
X dollars to the talent that performed. But it would be a <br>
known cost. That's the thing that trips everybody up and makes <br>
this kind of product hard to get off the ground. If you knew I have <br>
a hundred minutes of film in this product and it's going to cost me <br>
X, then you build your budget around it, and you can get invest-ments <br>
and everything else that you need to produce it. But if you <br>
say, "Oh, I want a hundred minutes of something and I have no <br>
idea what it's going to cost me, and a certain number of people are <br>
going to hold me up for money," then it becomes difficult to put <br>
one of these things together. <br>
</p><p>
Alben worked for a big company. His company was backed by some <br>
of the richest investors in the world. He therefore had authority and <br>
access that the average Web designer would not have. So if it took him <br>
a year, how long would it take someone else? And how much creativity <br>
is never made just because the costs of clearing the rights are so high? <br>
These costs are the burdens of a kind of regulation. Put on a Re-publican <br>
hat for a moment, and get angry for a bit. The government <br>
defines the scope of these rights, and the scope defined determines <br>
how much it's going to cost to negotiate them. (Remember the idea <br>
that land runs to the heavens, and imagine the pilot purchasing fly-through <br>
rights as he negotiates to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco.) <br>
These rights might well have once made sense; but as circumstances <br>
change, they make no sense at all. Or at least, a well-trained, regulation-minimizing <br>
Republican should look at the rights and ask, "Does this <br>
still make sense?" <br>
I've seen the flash of recognition when people get this point, but only <br>
a few times. The first was at a conference of federal judges in California. <br>
The judges were gathered to discuss the emerging topic of cyber-law. I <br>
was asked to be on the panel. Harvey Saferstein, a well-respected lawyer <br>

When the lights came up, I looked over to my copanelist, David <br>
Nimmer, perhaps the leading copyright scholar and practitioner in the <br>
nation. He had an astonished look on his face, as he peered across the <br>
room of over 250 well-entertained judges. Taking an ominous tone, he <br>
began his talk with a question: "Do you know how many federal laws <br>
were just violated in this room?" <br>
For of course, the two brilliantly talented creators who made this <br>
film hadn't done what Alben did. They hadn't spent a year clearing the <br>
rights to these clips; technically, what they had done violated the law. <br>
Of course, it wasn't as if they or anyone were going to be prosecuted for <br>
this violation (the presence of 250 judges and a gaggle of federal mar-shals <br>
notwithstanding). But Nimmer was making an important point: <br>
A year before anyone would have heard of the word Napster, and two <br>
years before another member of our panel, David Boies, would defend <br>
Napster before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Nimmer was try-ing <br>
to get the judges to see that the law would not be friendly to the <br>
capacities that this technology would enable. Technology means you <br>
can now do amazing things easily; but you couldn't easily do them <br>
legally. <br>

<tt>We live in </tt>a "cut and paste" culture enabled by technology. Anyone <br>
building a presentation knows the extraordinary freedom that the cut <br>
and paste architecture of the Internet created&mdash;in a second you can <br>
find just about any image you want; in another second, you can have it <br>
planted in your presentation. <br>

its archives, musicians are able to string together mixes of sound never <br>
before imagined; filmmakers are able to build movies out of clips on <br>
computers around the world. An extraordinary site in Sweden takes <br>
images of politicians and blends them with music to create biting po-litical <br>
commentary. A site called Camp Chaos has produced some of <br>
the most biting criticism of the record industry that there is through <br>
the mixing of Flash! and music. <br>
All of these creations are technically illegal. Even if the creators <br>
wanted to be "legal," the cost of complying with the law is impossibly <br>
high. Therefore, for the law-abiding sorts, a wealth of creativity is <br>
never made. And for that part that is made, if it doesn't follow the <br>
clearance rules, it doesn't get released. <br>
To some, these stories suggest a solution: Let's alter the mix of <br>
rights so that people are free to build upon our culture. Free to add or <br>
mix as they see fit. We could even make this change without necessar-ily <br>
requiring that the "free" use be free as in "free beer." Instead, the sys-tem <br>
could simply make it easy for follow-on creators to compensate <br>
artists without requiring an army of lawyers to come along: a rule, for <br>
example, that says "the royalty owed the copyright owner of an unreg-istered <br>
work for the derivative reuse of his work will be a flat 1 percent <br>
of net revenues, to be held in escrow for the copyright owner." Under <br>
this rule, the copyright owner could benefit from some royalty, but he <br>
would not have the benefit of a full property right (meaning the right <br>
to name his own price) unless he registers the work. <br>
Who could possibly object to this? And what reason would there be <br>
for objecting? We're talking about work that is not now being made; <br>
which if made, under this plan, would produce new income for artists. <br>
What reason would anyone have to oppose it? <br>

<tt>In February 2003, </tt>DreamWorks studios announced an agree-ment <br>
with Mike Myers, the comic genius of <i>Saturday Night Live </i>and <br>
Austin Powers. According to the announcement, Myers and Dream-106 <br>

<br>

Works would work together to form a "unique filmmaking pact." Under <br>
the agreement, DreamWorks "will acquire the rights to existing motion <br>
picture hits and classics, write new storylines and&mdash;with the use of state-of-<br>
the-art digital technology&mdash;insert Myers and other actors into the <br>
film, thereby creating an entirely new piece of entertainment." <br>
The announcement called this "film sampling." As Myers ex-plained, <br>
"Film Sampling is an exciting way to put an original spin on <br>
existing films and allow audiences to see old movies in a new light. Rap <br>
artists have been doing this for years with music and now we are able <br>
to take that same concept and apply it to film." Steven Spielberg is <br>
quoted as saying, "If anyone can create a way to bring old films to new <br>
audiences, it is Mike." <br>
Spielberg is right. Film sampling by Myers will be brilliant. But if <br>
you don't think about it, you might miss the truly astonishing point <br>
about this announcement. As the vast majority of our film heritage re-mains <br>
under copyright, the real meaning of the DreamWorks an-nouncement <br>
is just this: It is Mike Myers and only Mike Myers who is <br>
free to sample. Any general freedom to build upon the film archive of <br>
our culture, a freedom in other contexts presumed for us all, is now a <br>
privilege reserved for the funny and famous&mdash;and presumably rich. <br>
This privilege becomes reserved for two sorts of reasons. The first <br>
continues the story of the last chapter: the vagueness of "fair use." <br>
Much of "sampling" should be considered "fair use." But few would <br>
rely upon so weak a doctrine to create. That leads to the second reason <br>
that the privilege is reserved for the few: The costs of negotiating the <br>
legal rights for the creative reuse of content are astronomically high. <br>
These costs mirror the costs with fair use: You either pay a lawyer to <br>
defend your fair use rights or pay a lawyer to track down permissions <br>
so you don't have to rely upon fair use rights. Either way, the creative <br>
process is a process of paying lawyers&mdash;again a privilege, or perhaps a <br>
curse, reserved for the few. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER NINE: Collectors <br>
In April 1996, </tt>millions of "bots"&mdash;computer codes designed to <br>
"spider," or automatically search the Internet and copy content&mdash;began <br>
running across the Net. Page by page, these bots copied Internet-based <br>
information onto a small set of computers located in a basement in San <br>
Francisco's Presidio. Once the bots finished the whole of the Internet, <br>
they started again. Over and over again, once every two months, these <br>
bits of code took copies of the Internet and stored them. <br>
By October 2001, the bots had collected more than five years of <br>
copies. And at a small announcement in Berkeley, California, the archive <br>
that these copies created, the Internet Archive, was opened to the <br>
world. Using a technology called "the Way Back Machine," you could <br>
enter a Web page, and see all of its copies going back to 1996, as well <br>
as when those pages changed. <br>
This is the thing about the Internet that Orwell would have appre-ciated. <br>
In the dystopia described in <i>1984, </i>old newspapers were con-stantly <br>
updated to assure that the current view of the world, approved <br>
of by the government, was not contradicted by previous news reports. <br>

Thousands of workers constantly reedited the past, meaning there was <br>
no way ever to know whether the story you were reading today was the <br>
story that was printed on the date published on the paper. <br>
It's the same with the Internet. If you go to a Web page today, <br>
there's no way for you to know whether the content you are reading is <br>
the same as the content you read before. The page may seem the same, <br>
but the content could easily be different. The Internet is Orwell's li-brary&mdash;<br>
constantly updated, without any reliable memory. <br>
Until the Way Back Machine, at least. With the Way Back Ma-chine, <br>
and the Internet Archive underlying it, you can see what the <br>
Internet was. You have the power to see what you remember. More <br>
importantly, perhaps, you also have the power to find what you don't <br>
remember and what others might prefer you forget. 1 <br>
</p><p>
<tt>We take it </tt>for granted that we can go back to see what we remem-ber <br>
reading. Think about newspapers. If you wanted to study the reac-tion <br>
of your hometown newspaper to the race riots in Watts in 1965, <br>
or to Bull Connor's water cannon in 1963, you could go to your public <br>
library and look at the newspapers. Those papers probably exist on <br>
microfiche. If you're lucky, they exist in paper, too. Either way, you <br>
are free, using a library, to go back and remember&mdash;not just what it is <br>
convenient to remember, but remember something close to the truth. <br>
It is said that those who fail to remember history are doomed to re-peat <br>
it. That's not quite correct. We <i>all </i>forget history. The key is whether <br>
we have a way to go back to rediscover what we forget. More directly, the <br>
key is whether an objective past can keep us honest. Libraries help do <br>
that, by collecting content and keeping it, for schoolchildren, for re-searchers, <br>
for grandma. A free society presumes this knowedge. <br>
The Internet was an exception to this presumption. Until the In-ternet <br>
Archive, there was no way to go back. The Internet was the <br>
quintessentially transitory medium. And yet, as it becomes more im-portant <br>
in forming and reforming society, it becomes more and more im-" <br>

portant to maintain in some historical form. It's just bizarre to think that <br>
we have scads of archives of newspapers from tiny towns around the <br>
world, yet there is but one copy of the Internet&mdash;the one kept by the In-ternet <br>
Archive. <br>
Brewster Kahle is the founder of the Internet Archive. He was a very <br>
successful Internet entrepreneur after he was a successful computer re-searcher. <br>
In the 1990s, Kahle decided he had had enough business suc-cess. <br>
It was time to become a different kind of success. So he launched <br>
a series of projects designed to archive human knowledge. The Inter-net <br>
Archive was just the first of the projects of this Andrew Carnegie <br>
of the Internet. By December of 2002, the archive had over 10 billion <br>
pages, and it was growing at about a billion pages a month. <br>
The Way Back Machine is the largest archive of human knowledge <br>
in human history. At the end of 2002, it held "two hundred and thirty <br>
terabytes of material"&mdash;and was "ten times larger than the Library of <br>
Congress." And this was just the first of the archives that Kahle set <br>
out to build. In addition to the Internet Archive, Kahle has been con-structing <br>
the Television Archive. Television, it turns out, is even more <br>
ephemeral than the Internet. While much of twentieth-century culture <br>
was constructed through television, only a tiny proportion of that cul-ture <br>
is available for anyone to see today. Three hours of news are re-corded <br>
each evening by Vanderbilt University&mdash;thanks to a specific <br>
exemption in the copyright law. That content is indexed, and is available <br>
to scholars for a very low fee. "But other than that, [television] is almost <br>
unavailable," Kahle told me. "If you were Barbara Walters you could get <br>
access to [the archives], but if you are just a graduate student?" As Kahle <br>
put it, <br>
</p><p>
Do you remember when Dan Quayle was interacting with Mur-phy <br>
Brown? Remember that back and forth surreal experience of <br>
a politician interacting with a fictional television character? If you <br>
were a graduate student wanting to study that, and you wanted to <br>

<i>60 Minutes </i>episode that came out after it ... it would be almost <br>
impossible. ... Those materials are almost unfindable. . . . <br>
</p><p>
Why is that? Why is it that the part of our culture that is recorded <br>
in newspapers remains perpetually accessible, while the part that is <br>
recorded on videotape is not? How is it that we've created a world <br>
where researchers trying to understand the effect of media on nineteenth-century <br>
America will have an easier time than researchers trying to un-derstand <br>
the effect of media on twentieth-century America? <br>
In part, this is because of the law. Early in American copyright law, <br>
copyright owners were required to deposit copies of their work in li-braries. <br>
These copies were intended both to facilitate the spread of <br>
knowledge and to assure that a copy of the work would be around once <br>
the copyright expired, so that others might access and copy the work. <br>
These rules applied to film as well. But in 1915, the Library of Con-gress <br>
made an exception for film. Film could be copyrighted so long <br>
as such deposits were made. But the filmmaker was then allowed to <br>
borrow back the deposits&mdash;for an unlimited time at no cost. In 1915 <br>
alone, there were more than 5,475 films deposited and "borrowed back." <br>
Thus, when the copyrights to films expire, there is no copy held by any <br>
library. The copy exists&mdash;if it exists at all&mdash;in the library archive of the <br>
film company. 2 <br>
The same is generally true about television. Television broadcasts <br>
were originally not copyrighted&mdash;there was no way to capture the <br>
broadcasts, so there was no fear of "theft." But as technology enabled <br>
capturing, broadcasters relied increasingly upon the law. The law re-quired <br>
they make a copy of each broadcast for the work to be "copy-righted." <br>
But those copies were simply kept by the broadcasters. No <br>
library had any right to them; the government didn't demand them. <br>
The content of this part of American culture is practically invisible to <br>
anyone who would look. <br>
Kahle was eager to correct this. Before September 11, 2001, he and <br>
his allies had started capturing television. They selected twenty sta-" <br>

<br>
</p><p>
tions from around the world and hit the Record button. After Septem-ber <br>
11, Kahle, working with dozens of others, selected twenty stations <br>
from around the world and, beginning October 11, 2001, made their <br>
coverage during the week of September 11 available free on-line. Any-one <br>
could see how news reports from around the world covered the <br>
events of that day. <br>
Kahle had the same idea with film. Working with Rick Prelinger, <br>
whose archive of film includes close to 45,000 "ephemeral films" <br>
(meaning films other than Hollywood movies, films that were never <br>
copyrighted), Kahle established the Movie Archive. Prelinger let Kahle <br>
digitize 1,300 films in this archive and post those films on the Internet <br>
to be downloaded for free. Prelinger's is a for-profit company. It sells <br>
copies of these films as stock footage. What he has discovered is that <br>
after he made a significant chunk available for free, his stock footage <br>
sales went up dramatically. People could easily find the material they <br>
wanted to use. Some downloaded that material and made films on <br>
their own. Others purchased copies to enable other films to be made. <br>
Either way, the archive enabled access to this important part of our cul-ture. <br>
Want to see a copy of the "Duck and Cover" film that instructed <br>
children how to save themselves in the middle of nuclear attack? Go to <br>
archive. org, and you can download the film in a few minutes&mdash;for free. <br>
Here again, Kahle is providing access to a part of our culture that <br>
we otherwise could not get easily, if at all. It is yet another part of what <br>
defines the twentieth century that we have lost to history. The law <br>
doesn't require these copies to be kept by anyone, or to be deposited in <br>
an archive by anyone. Therefore, there is no simple way to find them. <br>
The key here is access, not price. Kahle wants to enable free access to <br>
this content, but he also wants to enable others to sell access to it. His <br>
aim is to ensure competition in access to this important part of our cul-ture. <br>
Not during the commercial life of a bit of creative property, but dur-ing <br>
a second life that all creative property has&mdash;a noncommercial life. <br>
For here is an idea that we should more clearly recognize. Every bit <br>
of creative property goes through different "lives." In its first life, if the <br>

creator is lucky, the content is sold. In such cases the commercial mar-ket <br>
is successful for the creator. The vast majority of creative property <br>
doesn't enjoy such success, but some clearly does. For that content, <br>
commercial life is extremely important. Without this commercial mar-ket, <br>
there would be, many argue, much less creativity. <br>
After the commercial life of creative property has ended, our tradi-tion <br>
has always supported a second life as well. A newspaper delivers <br>
the news every day to the doorsteps of America. The very next day, it is <br>
used to wrap fish or to fill boxes with fragile gifts or to build an archive <br>
of knowledge about our history. In this second life, the content can <br>
continue to inform even if that information is no longer sold. <br>
The same has always been true about books. A book goes out of <br>
print very quickly (the average today is after about a year 3 ). After it is <br>
out of print, it can be sold in used book stores without the copyright <br>
owner getting anything and stored in libraries, where many get to read <br>
the book, also for free. Used book stores and libraries are thus the sec-ond <br>
life of a book. That second life is extremely important to the <br>
spread and stability of culture. <br>
Yet increasingly, any assumption about a stable second life for cre-ative <br>
property does not hold true with the most important components <br>
of popular culture in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. For <br>
these&mdash;television, movies, music, radio, the Internet&mdash;there is no guar-antee <br>
of a second life. For these sorts of culture, it is as if we've replaced <br>
libraries with Barnes &amp; Noble superstores. With this culture, what's <br>
accessible is nothing but what a certain limited market demands. Be-yond <br>
that, culture disappears. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>For most of </tt>the twentieth century, it was economics that made this <br>
so. It would have been insanely expensive to collect and make accessi-ble <br>
all television and film and music: The cost of analog copies is ex-traordinarily <br>
high. So even though the law in principle would have <br>
restricted the ability of a Brewster Kahle to copy culture generally, the <br>

<br>
</p><p>
real restriction was economics. The market made it impossibly difficult <br>
to do anything about this ephemeral culture; the law had little practi-cal <br>
effect. <br>
Perhaps the single most important feature of the digital revolution <br>
is that for the first time since the Library of Alexandria, it is feasible to <br>
imagine constructing archives that hold all culture produced or distrib-uted <br>
publicly. Technology makes it possible to imagine an archive of all <br>
books published, and increasingly makes it possible to imagine an <br>
archive of all moving images and sound. <br>
The scale of this potential archive is something we've never imag-ined <br>
before. The Brewster Kahles of our history have dreamed about it; <br>
but we are for the first time at a point where that dream is possible. As <br>
Kahle describes, <br>
</p><p>
It looks like there's about two to three million recordings of mu-sic. <br>
Ever. There are about a hundred thousand theatrical releases <br>
of movies, ... and about one to two million movies [distributed] <br>
during the twentieth century. There are about twenty-six million <br>
different titles of books. All of these would fit on computers that <br>
would fit in this room and be able to be afforded by a small com-pany. <br>
So we're at a turning point in our history. Universal access is <br>
the goal. And the opportunity of leading a different life, based on <br>
this, is ... thrilling. It could be one of the things humankind <br>
would be most proud of. Up there with the Library of Alexandria, <br>
putting a man on the moon, and the invention of the printing <br>
press. <br>
</p><p>
Kahle is not the only librarian. The Internet Archive is not the only <br>
archive. But Kahle and the Internet Archive suggest what the future of <br>
libraries or archives could be. <i>When </i>the commercial life of creative <br>
property ends, I don't know. But it does. And whenever it does, Kahle <br>
and his archive hint at a world where this knowledge, and culture, re-mains <br>
perpetually available. Some will draw upon it to understand it; <br>

the past for the future. These technologies promise something that had <br>
become unimaginable for much of our past&mdash;a future <i>for </i>our past. The <br>
technology of digital arts could make the dream of the Library of <br>
Alexandria real again. <br>
Tec hnologists have thus removed the economic costs of building <br>
such an archive. But lawyers' costs remain. For as much as we might <br>
like to call these "archives," as warm as the idea of a "library" might <br>
seem, the "content" that is collected in these digital spaces is also some-one's <br>
"property." And the law of property restricts the freedoms that <br>

<tt>CHAPTER TEN: "Property" <br>
Jack Valenti </tt>has been the president of the Motion Picture Asso-ciation <br>
of America since 1966. He first came to Washington, D. C., <br>
with Lyndon Johnson's administration&mdash;literally. The famous picture <br>
of Johnson's swearing-in on Air Force One after the assassination of <br>
President Kennedy has Valenti in the background. In his almost forty <br>
years of running the MPAA, Valenti has established himself as perhaps <br>
the most prominent and effective lobbyist in Washington. <br>
The MPAA is the American branch of the international Motion <br>
Picture Association. It was formed in 1922 as a trade association whose <br>
goal was to defend American movies against increasing domestic crit-icism. <br>
The organization now represents not only filmmakers but pro-ducers <br>
and distributors of entertainment for television, video, and <br>
cable. Its board is made up of the chairmen and presidents of the seven <br>
major producers and distributors of motion picture and television pro-grams <br>
in the United States: Walt Disney, Sony Pictures Entertain-ment, <br>
MGM, Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Universal <br>
Studios, and Warner Brothers. <br>

<br>

Valenti is only the third president of the MPAA. No president <br>
before him has had as much influence over that organization, or over <br>
Washington. As a Texan, Valenti has mastered the single most impor-tant <br>
political skill of a Southerner&mdash;the ability to appear simple and <br>
slow while hiding a lightning-fast intellect. To this day, Valenti plays <br>
the simple, humble man. But this Harvard MBA, and author of four <br>
books, who finished high school at the age of fifteen and flew more <br>
than fifty combat missions in World War II, is no Mr. Smith. When <br>
Valenti went to Washington, he mastered the city in a quintessentially <br>
Washingtonian way. <br>
In defending artistic liberty and the freedom of speech that our cul-ture <br>
depends upon, the MPAA has done important good. In crafting <br>
the MPAA rating system, it has probably avoided a great deal of <br>
speech-regulating harm. But there is an aspect to the organization's <br>
mission that is both the most radical and the most important. This is <br>
the organization's effort, epitomized in Valenti's every act, to redefine <br>
the meaning of "creative property." <br>
In 1982, Valenti's testimony to Congress captured the strategy per-fectly: <br>

No matter the lengthy arguments made, no matter the charges <br>
and the counter-charges, no matter the tumult and the shouting, <br>
reasonable men and women will keep returning to the fundamen-tal <br>
issue, the central theme which animates this entire debate: <i>Cre-ative <br>
property owners must be accorded the same rights and protection <br>
resident in all other property owners in the nation. </i>That is the issue. <br>
That is the question. And that is the rostrum on which this entire <br>
hearing and the debates to follow must rest. 1 <br>
</p><p>
The strategy of this rhetoric, like the strategy of most of Valenti's <br>
rhetoric, is brilliant and simple and brilliant because simple. The "cen-tral <br>
theme" to which "reasonable men and women" will return is this: <br>
"Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and pro-" <br>

</p><p>
tections resident in all other property owners in the nation." There are <br>
no second-class citizens, Valenti might have continued. There should <br>
be no second-class property owners. <br>
This claim has an obvious and powerful intuitive pull. It is stated <br>
with such clarity as to make the idea as obvious as the notion that we <br>
use elections to pick presidents. But in fact, there is no more extreme a <br>
claim made by <i>anyone </i>who is serious in this debate than this claim of <br>
Valenti's. Jack Valenti, however sweet and however brilliant, is perhaps <br>
the nation's foremost extremist when it comes to the nature and scope <br>
of "creative property." His views have <i>no </i>reasonable connection to our <br>
actual legal tradition, even if the subtle pull of his Texan charm has <br>
slowly redefined that tradition, at least in Washington. <br>
While "creative property" is certainly "property" in a nerdy and pre-cise <br>
sense that lawyers are trained to understand, 2 it has never been the <br>
case, nor should it be, that "creative property owners" have been "ac-corded <br>
the same rights and protection resident in all other property <br>
owners." Indeed, if creative property owners were given the same rights <br>
as all other property owners, that would effect a radical, and radically <br>
undesirable, change in our tradition. <br>
Valenti knows this. But he speaks for an industry that cares squat <br>
for our tradition and the values it represents. He speaks for an industry <br>
that is instead fighting to restore the tradition that the British over-turned <br>
in 1710. In the world that Valenti's changes would create, a <br>
powerful few would exercise powerful control over how our creative <br>
culture would develop. <br>
I have two purposes in this chapter. The first is to convince you <br>
that, historically, Valenti's claim is absolutely wrong. The second is to <br>
convince you that it would be terribly wrong for us to reject our his-tory. <br>
We have always treated rights in creative property differently <br>
from the rights resident in all other property owners. They have never <br>
been the same. And they should never be the same, because, however <br>
counterintuitive this may seem, to make them the same would be to <br>

fundamentally weaken the opportunity for new creators to create. Cre-ativity <br>
depends upon the owners of creativity having less than perfect <br>
control. <br>
Organizations such as the MPAA, whose board includes the most <br>
powerful of the old guard, have little interest, their rhetoric notwith-standing, <br>
in assuring that the new can displace them. No organization <br>
does. No person does. (Ask me about tenure, for example.) But what's <br>
good for the MPAA is not necessarily good for America. A society that <br>
defends the ideals of free culture must preserve precisely the opportu-nity <br>
for new creativity to threaten the old. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>To get </tt>just a hint that there is something fundamentally wrong in <br>
Valenti's argument, we need look no further than the United States <br>
Constitution itself. <br>
The framers of our Constitution loved "property." Indeed, so <br>
strongly did they love property that they built into the Constitution an <br>
important requirement. If the government takes your property&mdash;if it <br>
condemns your house, or acquires a slice of land from your farm&mdash;it is <br>
required, under the Fifth Amendment's "Takings Clause," to pay you <br>
"just compensation" for that taking. The Constitution thus guarantees <br>
that property is, in a certain sense, sacred. It cannot <i>ever </i>be taken from <br>
the property owner unless the government pays for the privilege. <br>
Yet the very same Constitution speaks very differently about what <br>
Valenti calls "creative property." In the clause granting Congress the <br>
power to create "creative property," the Constitution <i>requires </i>that after <br>
a "limited time," Congress take back the rights that it has granted and <br>
set the "creative property" free to the public domain. Yet when Con-gress <br>
does this, when the expiration of a copyright term "takes" your <br>
copyright and turns it over to the public domain, Congress does not <br>
have any obligation to pay "just compensation" for this "taking." In-stead, <br>
the same Constitution that requires compensation for your land <br>

<a href="#page133">133</a>
<br>
</p><p>
requires that you lose your "creative property" right without any com-pensation <br>
at all. <br>
The Constitution thus on its face states that these two forms of <br>
property are not to be accorded the same rights. They are plainly to be <br>
treated differently. Valenti is therefore not just asking for a change in <br>
our tradition when he argues that creative-property owners should be <br>
accorded the same rights as every other property-right owner. He is ef-fectively <br>
arguing for a change in our Constitution itself. <br>
Arguing for a change in our Constitution is not necessarily wrong. <br>
There was much in our original Constitution that was plainly wrong. <br>
The Constitution of 1789 entrenched slavery; it left senators to be ap-pointed <br>
rather than elected; it made it possible for the electoral college <br>
to produce a tie between the president and his own vice president (as it <br>
did in 1800). The framers were no doubt extraordinary, but I would be <br>
the first to admit that they made big mistakes. We have since rejected <br>
some of those mistakes; no doubt there could be others that we should <br>
reject as well. So my argument is not simply that because Jefferson did <br>
it, we should, too. <br>
Instead, my argument is that because Jefferson did it, we should at <br>
least try to understand <i>why. </i>Why did the framers, fanatical property <br>
types that they were, reject the claim that creative property be given the <br>
same rights as all other property? Why did they require that for cre-ative <br>
property there must be a public domain? <br>
To answer this question, we need to get some perspective on the his-tory <br>
of these "creative property" rights, and the control that they en-abled. <br>
Once we see clearly how differently these rights have been <br>
defined, we will be in a better position to ask the question that should <br>
be at the core of this war: Not <i>whether </i>creative property should be pro-tected, <br>
but how. Not <i>whether </i>we will enforce the rights the law gives to <br>
creative-property owners, but what the particular mix of rights ought to <br>
be. Not <i>whether </i>artists should be paid, but whether institutions designed <br>
to assure that artists get paid need also control how culture develops. <br>

<br>

To answer these questions, we need a more general way to talk <br>
about how property is protected. More precisely, we need a more gen-eral <br>
way than the narrow language of the law allows. In <i>Code and Other <br>
Laws of Cyberspace, </i>I used a simple model to capture this more general <br>
perspective. For any particular right or regulation, this model asks how <br>
four different modalities of regulation interact to support or weaken <br>
the right or regulation. I represented it with this diagram: <br>
</p><p>
<tt>"PROPERTY" 121 <br>
</tt>At the center of this picture is a regulated dot: the individual or <br>
group that is the target of regulation, or the holder of a right. (In each <br>
case throughout, we can describe this either as regulation or as a right. <br>
For simplicity's sake, I will speak only of regulations.) The ovals repre-sent <br>
four ways in which the individual or group might be regulated&mdash;<br>
either constrained or, alternatively, enabled. Law is the most obvious <br>
constraint (to lawyers, at least). It constrains by threatening punish-ments <br>
after the fact if the rules set in advance are violated. So if, for ex-ample, <br>
you willfully infringe Madonna's copyright by copying a song <br>
from her latest CD and posting it on the Web, you can be punished 
133
<br>
<a href="#page133">133</a>
<strong><a name="page134"> Page 134</a></strong>
<a href="#page135">135</a>
<br>
</p><p>
with a $150,000 fine. The fine is an ex post punishment for violating <br>
an ex ante rule. It is imposed by the state. <br>
Norms are a different kind of constraint. They, too, punish an indi-vidual <br>
for violating a rule. But the punishment of a norm is imposed by <br>
a community, not (or not only) by the state. There may be no law <br>
against spitting, but that doesn't mean you won't be punished if you <br>
spit on the ground while standing in line at a movie. The punishment <br>
might not be harsh, though depending upon the community, it could <br>
easily be more harsh than many of the punishments imposed by the <br>
state. The mark of the difference is not the severity of the rule, but the <br>
source of the enforcement. <br>
The market is a third type of constraint. Its constraint is effected <br>
through conditions: You can do X if you pay Y; you'll be paid M if <br>
you do N. These constraints are obviously not independent of law or <br>
norms&mdash;it is property law that defines what must be bought if it is to be <br>
taken legally; it is norms that say what is appropriately sold. But given a <br>
set of norms, and a background of property and contract law, the mar-ket <br>
imposes a simultaneous constraint upon how an individual or group <br>
might behave. <br>
Finally, and for the moment, perhaps, most mysteriously, "archi-tecture"&mdash;<br>
the physical world as one finds it&mdash;is a constraint on be-havior. <br>
A fallen bridge might constrain your ability to get across a <br>
river. Railroad tracks might constrain the ability of a community to <br>
integrate its social life. As with the market, architecture does not ef-fect <br>
its constraint through ex post punishments. Instead, also as with <br>
the market, architecture effects its constraint through simultaneous <br>
conditions. These conditions are imposed not by courts enforcing con-tracts, <br>
or by police punishing theft, but by nature, by "architecture." <br>
If a 500-pound boulder blocks your way, it is the law of gravity that <br>
enforces this constraint. If a $500 airplane ticket stands between <br>
you and a flight to New York, it is the market that enforces this con-straint. <br>

<br>

So the first point about these four modalities of regulation is obvi-ous: <br>
They interact. Restrictions imposed by one might be reinforced <br>
by another. Or restrictions imposed by one might be undermined by <br>
another. <br>
The second point follows directly: If we want to understand the <br>
effective freedom that anyone has at a given moment to do any partic-ular <br>
thing, we have to consider how these four modalities interact. <br>
Whether or not there are other constraints (there may well be; my <br>
claim is not about comprehensiveness), these four are among the most <br>
significant, and any regulator (whether controlling or freeing) must <br>
consider how these four in particular interact. <br>
So, for example, consider the "freedom" to drive a car at a high <br>
speed. That freedom is in part restricted by laws: speed limits that say <br>
how fast you can drive in particular places at particular times. It is in <br>
part restricted by architecture: speed bumps, for example, slow most ra-tional <br>
drivers; governors in buses, as another example, set the maxi-mum <br>
rate at which the driver can drive. The freedom is in part restricted <br>
by the market: Fuel efficiency drops as speed increases, thus the price of <br>
gasoline indirectly constrains speed. And finally, the norms of a com-munity <br>
may or may not constrain the freedom to speed. Drive at 50 <br>
mph by a school in your own neighborhood and you're likely to be <br>
punished by the neighbors. The same norm wouldn't be as effective in <br>
a different town, or at night. <br>
The final point about this simple model should also be fairly clear: <br>
While these four modalities are analytically independent, law has a <br>
special role in affecting the three. 3 The law, in other words, sometimes <br>
operates to increase or decrease the constraint of a particular modality. <br>
Thus, the law might be used to increase taxes on gasoline, so as to in-crease <br>
the incentives to drive more slowly. The law might be used to <br>
mandate more speed bumps, so as to increase the difficulty of driving <br>
rapidly. The law might be used to fund ads that stigmatize reckless <br>
driving. Or the law might be used to require that other laws be more <br>

</tt>strict&mdash;a federal requirement that states decrease the speed limit, for <br>
example&mdash;so as to decrease the attractiveness of fast driving. <br>
These constraints can thus change, and they can be changed. To <br>
understand the effective protection of liberty or protection of property <br>
at any particular moment, we must track these changes over time. A re-striction <br>
imposed by one modality might be erased by another. A free-dom <br>
enabled by one modality might be displaced by another. 4 <br>

<tt>Why Hollywood Is Right <br>
</tt>The most obvious point that this model reveals is just why, or just <br>
how, Hollywood is right. The copyright warriors have rallied Congress <br>
and the courts to defend copyright. This model helps us see why that <br>
rallying makes sense. <br>
Let's say this is the picture of copyright's regulation before the In-ternet: <br>

<tt>"PROPERTY" 125 <br>
</tt>There is balance between law, norms, market, and architecture. The <br>
law limits the ability to copy and share content, by imposing penalties <br>
on those who copy and share content. Those penalties are reinforced by <br>
technologies that make it hard to copy and share content (architecture) <br>
and expensive to copy and share content (market). Finally, those penal-ties <br>
are mitigated by norms we all recognize&mdash;kids, for example, taping <br>
other kids' records. These uses of copyrighted material may well be in-fringement, <br>
but the norms of our society (before the Internet, at least) <br>
had no problem with this form of infringement. <br>
Enter the Internet, or, more precisely, technologies such as MP3s <br>
and p2p sharing. Now the constraint of architecture changes dramati-cally, <br>
as does the constraint of the market. And as both the market and <br>
architecture relax the regulation of copyright, norms pile on. The <br>
happy balance (for the warriors, at least) of life before the Internet be-comes <br>
an effective state of anarchy after the Internet. <br>
Thus the sense of, and justification for, the warriors' response. Tech-nology <br>
has changed, the warriors say, and the effect of this change, <br>
when ramified through the market and norms, is that a balance of pro-tection <br>
for the copyright owners' rights has been lost. This is Iraq

</tt>after the fall of Saddam, but this time no government is justifying the <br>
looting that results. <br>
Neither this analysis nor the conclusions that follow are new to the <br>
warriors. Indeed, in a "White Paper" prepared by the Commerce De-partment <br>
(one heavily influenced by the copyright warriors) in 1995, <br>
this mix of regulatory modalities had already been identified and the <br>
strategy to respond already mapped. In response to the changes the In-ternet <br>
had effected, the White Paper argued (1) Congress should <br>
strengthen intellectual property law, (2) businesses should adopt inno-vative <br>
marketing techniques, (3) technologists should push to develop <br>
code to protect copyrighted material, and (4) educators should educate <br>
kids to better protect copyright. <br>
This mixed strategy is just what copyright needed&mdash;if it was to pre-serve <br>
the particular balance that existed before the change induced by <br>
the Internet. And it's just what we should expect the content industry <br>
to push for. It is as American as apple pie to consider the happy life <br>
you have as an entitlement, and to look to the law to protect it if some-thing <br>
comes along to change that happy life. Homeowners living in a <br>

flood plain have no hesitation appealing to the government to rebuild <br>
(and rebuild again) when a flood (architecture) wipes away their prop-erty <br>
(law). Farmers have no hesitation appealing to the government to <br>
bail them out when a virus (architecture) devastates their crop. Unions <br>
have no hesitation appealing to the government to bail them out when <br>
imports (market) wipe out the U. S. steel industry. <br>
Thus, there's nothing wrong or surprising in the content industry's <br>
campaign to protect itself from the harmful consequences of a techno-logical <br>
innovation. And I would be the last person to argue that the <br>
changing technology of the Internet has not had a profound effect on the <br>
content industry's way of doing business, or as John Seely Brown de-scribes <br>
it, its "architecture of revenue." <br>
But just because a particular interest asks for government support, <br>
it doesn't follow that support should be granted. And just because tech-nology <br>
has weakened a particular way of doing business, it doesn't fol-low <br>
that the government should intervene to support that old way of <br>
doing business. Kodak, for example, has lost perhaps as much as 20 <br>
percent of their traditional film market to the emerging technologies <br>
of digital cameras. 5 Does anyone believe the government should ban <br>
digital cameras just to support Kodak? Highways have weakened the <br>
freight business for railroads. Does anyone think we should ban trucks <br>
from roads <i>for the purpose of </i>protecting the railroads? Closer to the sub-ject <br>
of this book, remote channel changers have weakened the "sticki-ness" <br>
of television advertising (if a boring commercial comes on the <br>
TV, the remote makes it easy to surf ), and it may well be that this <br>
change has weakened the television advertising market. But does any-one <br>
believe we should regulate remotes to reinforce commercial televi-sion? <br>
(Maybe by limiting them to function only once a second, or to <br>
switch to only ten channels within an hour?) <br>
The obvious answer to these obviously rhetorical questions is no. <br>
In a free society, with a free market, supported by free enterprise and <br>
free trade, the government's role is not to support one way of doing <br>

business against others. Its role is not to pick winners and protect <br>
them against loss. If the government did this generally, then we would <br>
never have any progress. As Microsoft chairman Bill Gates wrote in <br>
1991, in a memo criticizing software patents, "established companies <br>
have an interest in excluding future competitors." 6 And relative to a <br>
startup, established companies also have the means. (Think RCA and <br>
FM radio.) A world in which competitors with new ideas must fight <br>
not only the market but also the government is a world in which <br>
competitors with new ideas will not succeed. It is a world of stasis and <br>
increasingly concentrated stagnation. It is the Soviet Union under <br>
Brezhnev. <br>
Thus, while it is understandable for industries threatened with new <br>
technologies that change the way they do business to look to the gov-ernment <br>
for protection, it is the special duty of policy makers to guar-antee <br>
that that protection not become a deterrent to progress. It is the <br>
duty of policy makers, in other words, to assure that the changes they <br>
create, in response to the request of those hurt by changing technology, <br>
are changes that preserve the incentives and opportunities for innova-tion <br>
and change. <br>
In the context of laws regulating speech&mdash;which include, obviously, <br>
copyright law&mdash;that duty is even stronger. When the industry com-plaining <br>
about changing technologies is asking Congress to respond in <br>
a way that burdens speech and creativity, policy makers should be es-pecially <br>
wary of the request. It is always a bad deal for the government <br>
to get into the business of regulating speech markets. The risks and <br>
dangers of that game are precisely why our framers created the First <br>
Amendment to our Constitution: "Congress shall make no law . . . <br>
abridging the freedom of speech." So when Congress is being asked to <br>
pass laws that would "abridge" the freedom of speech, it should ask&mdash;<br>
carefully&mdash;whether such regulation is justified. <br>
My argument just now, however, has nothing to do with whether <br>

fied." My argument is about their effect. For before we get to the ques-tion <br>
of justification, a hard question that depends a great deal upon <br>
your values, we should first ask whether we understand the effect of the <br>
changes the content industry wants. <br>
Here's the metaphor that will capture the argument to follow. <br>
In 1873, the chemical DDT was first synthesized. In 1948, Swiss <br>
chemist Paul Hermann Müller won the Nobel Prize for his work <br>
demonstrating the insecticidal properties of DDT. By the 1950s, the <br>
insecticide was widely used around the world to kill disease-carrying <br>
pests. It was also used to increase farm production. <br>
No one doubts that killing disease-carrying pests or increasing crop <br>
production is a good thing. No one doubts that the work of Müller was <br>
important and valuable and probably saved lives, possibly millions. <br>
But in 1962, Rachel Carson published <i>Silent Spring, </i>which argued <br>
that DDT, whatever its primary benefits, was also having unintended <br>
environmental consequences. Birds were losing the ability to repro-duce. <br>
Whole chains of the ecology were being destroyed. <br>
No one set out to destroy the environment. Paul Müller certainly <br>
did not aim to harm any birds. But the effort to solve one set of prob-lems <br>
produced another set which, in the view of some, was far worse <br>
than the problems that were originally attacked. Or more accurately, <br>
the problems DDT caused were worse than the problems it solved, at <br>
least when considering the other, more environmentally friendly ways <br>
to solve the problems that DDT was meant to solve. <br>
It is to this image precisely that Duke University law professor James <br>
Boyle appeals when he argues that we need an "environmentalism" for <br>
culture. 7 His point, and the point I want to develop in the balance of <br>
this chapter, is not that the aims of copyright are flawed. Or that au-thors <br>
should not be paid for their work. Or that music should be given <br>
away "for free." The point is that some of the ways in which we might <br>
protect authors will have unintended consequences for the cultural en-vironment, <br>
much like DDT had for the natural environment. And just <br>

as criticism of DDT is not an endorsement of malaria or an attack on <br>
farmers, so, too, is criticism of one particular set of regulations protect-ing <br>
copyright not an endorsement of anarchy or an attack on authors. <br>
It is an environment of creativity that we seek, and we should be aware <br>
of our actions' effects on the environment. <br>
My argument, in the balance of this chapter, tries to map exactly <br>
this effect. No doubt the technology of the Internet has had a dramatic <br>
effect on the ability of copyright owners to protect their content. But <br>
there should also be little doubt that when you add together the <br>
changes in copyright law over time, plus the change in technology that <br>
the Internet is undergoing just now, the net effect of these changes will <br>
not be only that copyrighted work is effectively protected. Also, and <br>
generally missed, the net effect of this massive increase in protection <br>
will be devastating to the environment for creativity. <br>

English copyright law. Our Constitution makes the purpose of <br>
"creative property" rights clear; its express limitations reinforce the En-glish <br>
aim to avoid overly powerful publishers. <br>
The power to establish "creative property" rights is granted to Con-gress <br>
in a way that, for our Constitution, at least, is very odd. Article I, <br>
section 8, clause 8 of our Constitution states that: <br>
</p><p>
Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science and <br>
useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors <br>
the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries. <br>

<br>

We can call this the "Progress Clause," for notice what this clause does <br>
not say. It does not say Congress has the power to grant "creative prop-erty <br>
rights." It says that Congress has the power <i>to promote progress. </i>The <br>
grant of power is its purpose, and its purpose is a public one, not the <br>
purpose of enriching publishers, nor even primarily the purpose of re-warding <br>
authors. <br>
The Progress Clause expressly limits the term of copyrights. As we <br>
saw in chapter 6, the English limited the term of copyright so as to as-sure <br>
that a few would not exercise disproportionate control over culture <br>
by exercising disproportionate control over publishing. We can assume <br>
the framers followed the English for a similar purpose. Indeed, unlike <br>
the English, the framers reinforced that objective, by requiring that <br>
copyrights extend "to Authors" only. <br>
The design of the Progress Clause reflects something about the <br>
Constitution's design in general. To avoid a problem, the framers built <br>
structure. To prevent the concentrated power of publishers, they built <br>
a structure that kept copyrights away from publishers and kept them <br>
short. To prevent the concentrated power of a church, they banned the <br>
federal government from establishing a church. To prevent concentrat-ing <br>
power in the federal government, they built structures to reinforce <br>
the power of the states&mdash;including the Senate, whose members were <br>
at the time selected by the states, and an electoral college, also selected <br>
by the states, to select the president. In each case, a <i>structure </i>built <br>
checks and balances into the constitutional frame, structured to pre-vent <br>
otherwise inevitable concentrations of power. <br>
I doubt the framers would recognize the regulation we call "copy-right" <br>
today. The scope of that regulation is far beyond anything they <br>
ever considered. To begin to understand what they did, we need to put <br>
our "copyright" in context: We need to see how it has changed in the <br>
210 years since they first struck its design. <br>

<tt>Law: Duration <br>
</tt>When the first Congress enacted laws to protect creative property, it <br>
faced the same uncertainty about the status of creative property that <br>
the English had confronted in 1774. Many states had passed laws pro-tecting <br>
creative property, and some believed that these laws simply <br>
supplemented common law rights that already protected creative au-thorship. 8 <br>
This meant that there was no guaranteed public domain in <br>
the United States in 1790. If copyrights were protected by the com-mon <br>
law, then there was no simple way to know whether a work pub-lished <br>
in the United States was controlled or free. Just as in England, <br>
this lingering uncertainty would make it hard for publishers to rely <br>
upon a public domain to reprint and distribute works. <br>
That uncertainty ended after Congress passed legislation granting <br>
copyrights. Because federal law overrides any contrary state law, federal <br>
protections for copyrighted works displaced any state law protections. <br>
Just as in England the Statute of Anne eventually meant that the copy-rights <br>
for all English works expired, a federal statute meant that any <br>
state copyrights expired as well. <br>
In 1790, Congress enacted the first copyright law. It created a fed-eral <br>
copyright and secured that copyright for fourteen years. If the au-thor <br>
was alive at the end of that fourteen years, then he could opt to <br>
renew the copyright for another fourteen years. If he did not renew the <br>
copyright, his work passed into the public domain. <br>
While there were many works created in the United States in the <br>
first ten years of the Republic, only 5 percent of the works were actu-ally <br>
registered under the federal copyright regime. Of all the work cre-ated <br>
in the United States both before 1790 and from 1790 through <br>
1800, 95 percent immediately passed into the public domain; the bal-ance <br>
would pass into the pubic domain within twenty-eight years at <br>
most, and more likely within fourteen years. 9 <br>
This system of renewal was a crucial part of the American system <br>
of copyright. It assured that the maximum terms of copyright would be <br>

<br>
</p><p>
granted only for works where they were wanted. After the initial term <br>
of fourteen years, if it wasn't worth it to an author to renew his copy-right, <br>
then it wasn't worth it to society to insist on the copyright, either. <br>
Fourteen years may not seem long to us, but for the vast majority of <br>
copyright owners at that time, it was long enough: Only a small mi-nority <br>
of them renewed their copyright after fourteen years; the bal-ance <br>
allowed their work to pass into the public domain. 10 <br>
Even today, this structure would make sense. Most creative work <br>
has an actual commercial life of just a couple of years. Most books fall <br>
out of print after one year. 11 When that happens, the used books are <br>
traded free of copyright regulation. Thus the books are no longer <i>effec-tively <br>
</i>controlled by copyright. The only practical commercial use of the <br>
books at that time is to sell the books as used books; that use&mdash;because <br>
it does not involve publication&mdash;is effectively free. <br>
In the first hundred years of the Republic, the term of copyright <br>
was changed once. In 1831, the term was increased from a maximum <br>
of 28 years to a maximum of 42 by increasing the initial term of copy-right <br>
from 14 years to 28 years. In the next fifty years of the Republic, <br>
the term increased once again. In 1909, Congress extended the renewal <br>
term of 14 years to 28 years, setting a maximum term of 56 years. <br>
Then, beginning in 1962, Congress started a practice that has de-fined <br>
copyright law since. Eleven times in the last forty years, Congress <br>
has extended the terms of existing copyrights; twice in those forty <br>
years, Congress extended the term of future copyrights. Initially, the <br>
extensions of existing copyrights were short, a mere one to two years. <br>
In 1976, Congress extended all existing copyrights by nineteen years. <br>
And in 1998, in the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, <br>
Congress extended the term of existing and future copyrights by <br>
twenty years. <br>
The effect of these extensions is simply to toll, or delay, the passing <br>
of works into the public domain. This latest extension means that the <br>
public domain will have been tolled for thirty-nine out of fifty-five <br>
years, or 70 percent of the time since 1962. Thus, in the twenty years <br>

<br>

after the Sonny Bono Act, while one million patents will pass into the <br>
public domain, zero copyrights will pass into the public domain by virtue <br>
of the expiration of a copyright term. <br>
The effect of these extensions has been exacerbated by another, <br>
little-noticed change in the copyright law. Remember I said that the <br>
framers established a two-part copyright regime, requiring a copyright <br>
owner to renew his copyright after an initial term. The requirement of <br>
renewal meant that works that no longer needed copyright protection <br>
would pass more quickly into the public domain. The works remaining <br>
under protection would be those that had some continuing commercial <br>
value. <br>
The United States abandoned this sensible system in 1976. For <br>
all works created after 1978, there was only one copyright term&mdash;the <br>
maximum term. For "natural" authors, that term was life plus fifty <br>
years. For corporations, the term was seventy-five years. Then, in 1992, <br>
Congress abandoned the renewal requirement for all works created <br>
before 1978. All works still under copyright would be accorded the <br>
maximum term then available. After the Sonny Bono Act, that term <br>
was ninety-five years. <br>
This change meant that American law no longer had an automatic <br>
way to assure that works that were no longer exploited passed into the <br>
public domain. And indeed, after these changes, it is unclear whether <br>
it is even possible to put works into the public domain. The public do-main <br>
is orphaned by these changes in copyright law. Despite the re-quirement <br>
that terms be "limited," we have no evidence that anything <br>
will limit them. <br>
The effect of these changes on the average duration of copyright is <br>
dramatic. In 1973, more than 85 percent of copyright owners failed to <br>
renew their copyright. That meant that the average term of copyright <br>
in 1973 was just 32.2 years. Because of the elimination of the renewal <br>
requirement, the average term of copyright is now the maximum term. <br>
In thirty years, then, the average term has tripled, from 32.2 years to 95 <br>
years. 12 <br>

<tt>Law: Scope <br>
</tt>The "scope" of a copyright is the range of rights granted by the law. <br>
The scope of American copyright has changed dramatically. Those <br>
changes are not necessarily bad. But we should understand the extent <br>
of the changes if we're to keep this debate in context. <br>
In 1790, that scope was very narrow. Copyright covered only "maps, <br>
charts, and books." That means it didn't cover, for example, music or <br>
architecture. More significantly, the right granted by a copyright gave <br>
the author the exclusive right to "publish" copyrighted works. That <br>
means someone else violated the copyright only if he republished the <br>
work without the copyright owner's permission. Finally, the right granted <br>
by a copyright was an exclusive right to that particular book. The right <br>
did not extend to what lawyers call "derivative works." It would not, <br>
therefore, interfere with the right of someone other than the author to <br>
translate a copyrighted book, or to adapt the story to a different form <br>
(such as a drama based on a published book). <br>
This, too, has changed dramatically. While the contours of copy-right <br>
today are extremely hard to describe simply, in general terms, the <br>
right covers practically any creative work that is reduced to a tangible <br>
form. It covers music as well as architecture, drama as well as computer <br>
programs. It gives the copyright owner of that creative work not only <br>
the exclusive right to "publish" the work, but also the exclusive right of <br>
control over any "copies" of that work. And most significant for our <br>
purposes here, the right gives the copyright owner control over not <br>
only his or her particular work, but also any "derivative work" that might <br>
grow out of the original work. In this way, the right covers more cre-ative <br>
work, protects the creative work more broadly, and protects works <br>
that are based in a significant way on the initial creative work. <br>
At the same time that the scope of copyright has expanded, proce-dural <br>
limitations on the right have been relaxed. I've already described <br>
the complete removal of the renewal requirement in 1992. In addition <br>
to the renewal requirement, for most of the history of American copy-136 <br>

right law, there was a requirement that a work be registered before it <br>
could receive the protection of a copyright. There was also a require-ment <br>
that any copyrighted work be marked either with that famous © <br>
or the word <i>copyright. </i>And for most of the history of American copy-right <br>
law, there was a requirement that works be deposited with the <br>
government before a copyright could be secured. <br>
The reason for the registration requirement was the sensible under-standing <br>
that for most works, no copyright was required. Again, in the <br>
first ten years of the Republic, 95 percent of works eligible for copy-right <br>
were never copyrighted. Thus, the rule reflected the norm: Most <br>
works apparently didn't need copyright, so registration narrowed the <br>
regulation of the law to the few that did. The same reasoning justified <br>
the requirement that a work be marked as copyrighted&mdash;that way it <br>
was easy to know whether a copyright was being claimed. The require-ment <br>
that works be deposited was to assure that after the copyright ex-pired, <br>
there would be a copy of the work somewhere so that it could be <br>
copied by others without locating the original author. <br>
All of these "formalities" were abolished in the American system <br>
when we decided to follow European copyright law. There is no re-quirement <br>
that you register a work to get a copyright; the copyright <br>
now is automatic; the copyright exists whether or not you mark your <br>
work with a ©; and the copyright exists whether or not you actually <br>
make a copy available for others to copy. <br>
Consider a practical example to understand the scope of these dif-ferences. <br>
</p><p>
If, in 1790, you wrote a book and you were one of the 5 percent who <br>
actually copyrighted that book, then the copyright law protected you <br>
against another publisher's taking your book and republishing it with-out <br>
your permission. The aim of the act was to regulate publishers so <br>
as to prevent that kind of unfair competition. In 1790, there were 174 <br>
publishers in the United States. 13 The Copyright Act was thus a tiny <br>
regulation of a tiny proportion of a tiny part of the creative market in <br>
the United States&mdash;publishers. <br>

<a href="#page151">151</a>
<br>
</p><p>
The act left other creators totally unregulated. If I copied your <br>
poem by hand, over and over again, as a way to learn it by heart, my <br>
act was totally unregulated by the 1790 act. If I took your novel and <br>
made a play based upon it, or if I translated it or abridged it, none of <br>
those activities were regulated by the original copyright act. These cre-ative <br>
activities remained free, while the activities of publishers were re-strained. <br>
</p><p>
Today the story is very different: If you write a book, your book is <br>
automatically protected. Indeed, not just your book. Every e-mail, <br>
every note to your spouse, every doodle, <i>every </i>creative act that's re-duced <br>
to a tangible form&mdash;all of this is automatically copyrighted. <br>
There is no need to register or mark your work. The protection follows <br>
the creation, not the steps you take to protect it. <br>
That protection gives you the right (subject to a narrow range of <br>
fair use exceptions) to control how others copy the work, whether they <br>
copy it to republish it or to share an excerpt. <br>
That much is the obvious part. Any system of copyright would con-trol <br>
competing publishing. But there's a second part to the copyright of <br>
today that is not at all obvious. This is the protection of "derivative <br>
rights." If you write a book, no one can make a movie out of your <br>
book without permission. No one can translate it without permission. <br>
CliffsNotes can't make an abridgment unless permission is granted. All <br>
of these derivative uses of your original work are controlled by the <br>
copyright holder. The copyright, in other words, is now not just an ex-clusive <br>
right to your writings, but an exclusive right to your writings <br>
and a large proportion of the writings inspired by them. <br>
It is this derivative right that would seem most bizarre to our <br>
framers, though it has become second nature to us. Initially, this ex-pansion <br>
was created to deal with obvious evasions of a narrower copy-right. <br>
If I write a book, can you change one word and then claim a <br>
copyright in a new and different book? Obviously that would make a <br>
joke of the copyright, so the law was properly expanded to include <br>
those slight modifications as well as the verbatim original work. <br>

<br>

In preventing that joke, the law created an astonishing power within <br>
a free culture&mdash;at least, it's astonishing when you understand that the <br>
law applies not just to the commercial publisher but to anyone with a <br>
computer. I understand the wrong in duplicating and selling someone <br>
else's work. But whatever <i>that </i>wrong is, transforming someone else's <br>
work is a different wrong. Some view transformation as no wrong at <br>
all&mdash;they believe that our law, as the framers penned it, should not pro-tect <br>
derivative rights at all. 14 Whether or not you go that far, it seems <br>
plain that whatever wrong is involved is fundamentally different from <br>
the wrong of direct piracy. <br>
Yet copyright law treats these two different wrongs in the same <br>
way. I can go to court and get an injunction against your pirating my <br>
book. I can go to court and get an injunction against your transforma-tive <br>
use of my book. 15 These two different uses of my creative work are <br>
treated the same. <br>
This again may seem right to you. If I wrote a book, then why <br>
should you be able to write a movie that takes my story and makes <br>
money from it without paying me or crediting me? Or if Disney cre-ates <br>
a creature called "Mickey Mouse," why should you be able to make <br>
Mickey Mouse toys and be the one to trade on the value that Disney <br>
originally created? <br>
These are good arguments, and, in general, my point is not that the <br>
derivative right is unjustified. My aim just now is much narrower: sim-ply <br>
to make clear that this expansion is a significant change from the <br>
rights originally granted. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Law and Architecture: Reach <br>
</tt>Whereas originally the law regulated only publishers, the change in <br>
copyright's scope means that the law today regulates publishers, users, <br>
and authors. It regulates them because all three are capable of making <br>
copies, and the core of the regulation of copyright law is copies. 16 <br>

"Copies." That certainly sounds like the obvious thing for <i>copyright <br>
</i>law to regulate. But as with Jack Valenti's argument at the start of this <br>
chapter, that "creative property" deserves the "same rights" as all other <br>
property, it is the <i>obvious </i>that we need to be most careful about. For <br>
while it may be obvious that in the world before the Internet, copies <br>
were the obvious trigger for copyright law, upon reflection, it should be <br>
obvious that in the world with the Internet, copies should <i>not </i>be the <br>
trigger for copyright law. More precisely, they should not <i>always </i>be the <br>
trigger for copyright law. <br>
This is perhaps the central claim of this book, so let me take this <br>
very slowly so that the point is not easily missed. My claim is that the <br>
Internet should at least force us to rethink the conditions under which <br>
the law of copyright automatically applies, 17 because it is clear that the <br>
current reach of copyright was never contemplated, much less chosen, <br>
by the legislators who enacted copyright law. <br>
We can see this point abstractly by beginning with this largely <br>
empty circle. <br>

Think about a book in real space, and imagine this circle to repre-sent <br>
all its potential <i>uses. </i>Most of these uses are unregulated by copyright <br>
law, because the uses don't create a copy. If you read a book, that act is not <br>
regulated by copyright law. If you give someone the book, that act is <br>
not regulated by copyright law. If you resell a book, that act is not reg-ulated <br>
(copyright law expressly states that after the first sale of a book, <br>
the copyright owner can impose no further conditions on the disposi-tion <br>
of the book). If you sleep on the book or use it to hold up a lamp or <br>
let your puppy chew it up, those acts are not regulated by copyright law, <br>
because those acts do not make a copy. <br>

</tt>Obviously, however, some uses of a copyrighted book are regulated <br>
by copyright law. Republishing the book, for example, makes a copy. It <br>
is therefore regulated by copyright law. Indeed, this particular use stands <br>
at the core of this circle of possible uses of a copyrighted work. It is the <br>
paradigmatic use properly regulated by copyright regulation (see first <br>
diagram on next page). <br>
Finally, there is a tiny sliver of otherwise regulated copying uses <br>
that remain unregulated because the law considers these "fair uses."

These are uses that themselves involve copying, but which the law treats <br>
as unregulated because public policy demands that they remain unreg-ulated. <br>
You are free to quote from this book, even in a review that <br>
is quite negative, without my permission, even though that quoting <br>
makes a copy. That copy would ordinarily give the copyright owner the <br>
exclusive right to say whether the copy is allowed or not, but the law <br>
denies the owner any exclusive right over such "fair uses" for public <br>
policy (and possibly First Amendment) reasons. <br>

In real space, then, the possible uses of a book are divided into three <br>
sorts: (1) unregulated uses, (2) regulated uses, and (3) regulated uses that <br>
are nonetheless deemed "fair" regardless of the copyright owner's views. <br>
Enter the Internet&mdash;a distributed, digital network where every use <br>
of a copyrighted work produces a copy. 18 And because of this single, <br>
arbitrary feature of the design of a digital network, the scope of cate-gory <br>
1 changes dramatically. Uses that before were presumptively un-regulated <br>
are now presumptively regulated. No longer is there a set of <br>
presumptively unregulated uses that define a freedom associated with a <br>
copyrighted work. Instead, each use is now subject to the copyright, <br>
because each use also makes a copy&mdash;category 1 gets sucked into cate-gory <br>
2. And those who would defend the unregulated uses of copy-righted <br>
work must look exclusively to category 3, fair uses, to bear the <br>
burden of this shift. <br>
So let's be very specific to make this general point clear. Before the <br>
Internet, if you purchased a book and read it ten times, there would be <br>
no plausible <i>copyright-</i>related argument that the copyright owner could <br>
make to control that use of her book. Copyright law would have noth-ing <br>

But the same book as an e-book is effectively governed by a differ-ent <br>
set of rules. Now if the copyright owner says you may read the book <br>
only once or only once a month, then <i>copyright law </i>would aid the copy-right <br>
owner in exercising this degree of control, because of the acci-dental <br>
feature of copyright law that triggers its application upon there <br>
being a copy. Now if you read the book ten times and the license says <br>
you may read it only five times, then whenever you read the book (or <br>
any portion of it) beyond the fifth time, you are making a copy of the <br>
book contrary to the copyright owner's wish. <br>
There are some people who think this makes perfect sense. My aim <br>
just now is not to argue about whether it makes sense or not. My aim <br>
is only to make clear the change. Once you see this point, a few other <br>
points also become clear: <br>
First, making category 1 disappear is not anything any policy maker <br>
ever intended. Congress did not think through the collapse of the pre-sumptively <br>
unregulated uses of copyrighted works. There is no evi-dence <br>
at all that policy makers had this idea in mind when they allowed <br>
our policy here to shift. Unregulated uses were an important part of <br>
free culture before the Internet. <br>
Second, this shift is especially troubling in the context of transfor-mative <br>
uses of creative content. Again, we can all understand the wrong <br>
in commercial piracy. But the law now purports to regulate <i>any </i>trans-formation <br>
you make of creative work using a machine. "Copy and paste" <br>
and "cut and paste" become crimes. Tinkering with a story and releas-ing <br>
it to others exposes the tinkerer to at least a requirement of justifi-cation. <br>
However troubling the expansion with respect to copying a <br>
particular work, it is extraordinarily troubling with respect to transfor-mative <br>
uses of creative work. <br>
Third, this shift from category 1 to category 2 puts an extraordinary <br>

<br>

burden on category 3 (" fair use") that fair use never before had to bear. <br>
If a copyright owner now tried to control how many times I could read <br>
a book on-line, the natural response would be to argue that this is a <br>
violation of my fair use rights. But there has never been any litigation <br>
about whether I have a fair use right to read, because before the Inter-net, <br>
reading did not trigger the application of copyright law and hence <br>
the need for a fair use defense. The right to read was effectively pro-tected <br>
before because reading was not regulated. <br>
This point about fair use is totally ignored, even by advocates for <br>
free culture. We have been cornered into arguing that our rights de-pend <br>
upon fair use&mdash;never even addressing the earlier question about <br>
the expansion in effective regulation. A thin protection grounded in <br>
fair use makes sense when the vast majority of uses are <i>unregulated. </i>But <br>
when everything becomes presumptively regulated, then the protec-tions <br>
of fair use are not enough. <br>
The case of Video Pipeline is a good example. Video Pipeline was <br>
in the business of making "trailer" advertisements for movies available <br>
to video stores. The video stores displayed the trailers as a way to sell <br>
videos. Video Pipeline got the trailers from the film distributors, put <br>
the trailers on tape, and sold the tapes to the retail stores. <br>
The company did this for about fifteen years. Then, in 1997, it be-gan <br>
to think about the Internet as another way to distribute these pre-views. <br>
The idea was to expand their "selling by sampling" technique by <br>
giving on-line stores the same ability to enable "browsing." Just as in a <br>
bookstore you can read a few pages of a book before you buy the book, <br>
so, too, you would be able to sample a bit from the movie on-line be-fore <br>
you bought it. <br>
In 1998, Video Pipeline informed Disney and other film distribu-tors <br>
that it intended to distribute the trailers through the Internet <br>
(rather than sending the tapes) to distributors of their videos. Two <br>
years later, Disney told Video Pipeline to stop. The owner of Video <br>
Pipeline asked Disney to talk about the matter&mdash;he had built a busi-" <br>

</p><p>
ness on distributing this content as a way to help sell Disney films; he <br>
had customers who depended upon his delivering this content. Disney <br>
would agree to talk only if Video Pipeline stopped the distribution im-mediately. <br>
Video Pipeline thought it was within their "fair use" rights <br>
to distribute the clips as they had. So they filed a lawsuit to ask the <br>
court to declare that these rights were in fact their rights. <br>
Disney countersued&mdash;for $100 million in damages. Those damages <br>
were predicated upon a claim that Video Pipeline had "willfully in-fringed" <br>
on Disney's copyright. When a court makes a finding of will-ful <br>
infringement, it can award damages not on the basis of the actual <br>
harm to the copyright owner, but on the basis of an amount set in the <br>
statute. Because Video Pipeline had distributed seven hundred clips of <br>
Disney movies to enable video stores to sell copies of those movies, <br>
Disney was now suing Video Pipeline for $100 million. <br>
Disney has the right to control its property, of course. But the video <br>
stores that were selling Disney's films also had some sort of right to be <br>
able to sell the films that they had bought from Disney. Disney's claim <br>
in court was that the stores were allowed to sell the films and they were <br>
permitted to list the titles of the films they were selling, but they were <br>
not allowed to show clips of the films as a way of selling them without <br>
Disney's permission. <br>
Now, you might think this is a close case, and I think the courts would <br>
consider it a close case. My point here is to map the change that gives <br>
Disney this power. Before the Internet, Disney couldn't really control <br>
how people got access to their content. Once a video was in the market-place, <br>
the "first-sale doctrine" would free the seller to use the video as he <br>
wished, including showing portions of it in order to engender sales of the <br>
entire movie video. But with the Internet, it becomes possible for Disney <br>
to centralize control over access to this content. Because each use of the <br>
Internet produces a copy, use on the Internet becomes subject to the <br>
copyright owner's control. The technology expands the scope of effective <br>
control, because the technology builds a copy into every transaction. <br>
No doubt, a potential is not yet an abuse, and so the potential for con-146 <br>

<br>

trol is not yet the abuse of control. Barnes &amp; Noble has the right to say <br>
you can't touch a book in their store; property law gives them that right. <br>
But the market effectively protects against that abuse. If Barnes &amp; No-ble <br>
banned browsing, then consumers would choose other bookstores. <br>
Competition protects against the extremes. And it may well be (my argu-ment <br>
so far does not even question this) that competition would prevent <br>
any similar danger when it comes to copyright. Sure, publishers exercis-ing <br>
the rights that authors have assigned to them might try to regulate <br>
how many times you read a book, or try to stop you from sharing the book <br>
with anyone. But in a competitive market such as the book market, the <br>
dangers of this happening are quite slight. <br>
Again, my aim so far is simply to map the changes that this changed <br>
architecture enables. Enabling technology to enforce the control of <br>
copyright means that the control of copyright is no longer defined by <br>
balanced policy. The control of copyright is simply what private own-ers <br>
choose. In some contexts, at least, that fact is harmless. But in some <br>
contexts it is a recipe for disaster. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Architecture and Law: Force <br>
</tt>The disappearance of unregulated uses would be change enough, but a <br>
second important change brought about by the Internet magnifies its <br>
significance. This second change does not affect the reach of copyright <br>
regulation; it affects how such regulation is enforced. <br>
In the world before digital technology, it was generally the law that <br>
controlled whether and how someone was regulated by copyright law. <br>
The law, meaning a court, meaning a judge: In the end, it was a human, <br>
trained in the tradition of the law and cognizant of the balances that <br>
tradition embraced, who said whether and how the law would restrict <br>
your freedom. <br>

<i>Casablanca. </i>War ner Brothers objected. They wrote a nasty letter to the <br>
Marxes, warning them that there would be serious legal consequences <br>
if they went forward with their plan. 19 <br>
This led the Marx Brothers to respond in kind. They warned <br>
War ner Brothers that the Marx Brothers "were brothers long before <br>
you were." 20 The Marx Brothers therefore owned the word <i>brothers, <br>
</i>and if Warner Brothers insisted on trying to control <i>Casablanca, </i>then <br>
the Marx Brothers would insist on control over <i>brothers. <br>
</i>An absurd and hollow threat, of course, because Warner Brothers, <br>
like the Marx Brothers, knew that no court would ever enforce such a <br>
silly claim. This extremism was irrelevant to the real freedoms anyone <br>
(including Warner Brothers) enjoyed. <br>
On the Internet, however, there is no check on silly rules, because <br>
on the Internet, increasingly, rules are enforced not by a human but by <br>
a machine: Increasingly, the rules of copyright law, as interpreted by <br>
the copyright owner, get built into the technology that delivers copy-righted <br>
content. It is code, rather than law, that rules. And the problem <br>
with code regulations is that, unlike law, code has no shame. Code <br>
would not get the humor of the Marx Brothers. The consequence of <br>
that is not at all funny. <br>
Consider the life of my Adobe eBook Reader. <br>
An e-book is a book delivered in electronic form. An Adobe eBook <br>
is not a book that Adobe has published; Adobe simply produces the <br>
software that publishers use to deliver e-books. It provides the tech-nology, <br>

Now, the Adobe eBook Reader calls these controls "permissions"&mdash;<br>
as if the publisher has the power to control how you use these works. <br>
For works under copyright, the copyright owner certainly does have <br>
the power&mdash;up to the limits of the copyright law. But for work not un-der <br>
copyright, there is no such copyright power. 21 When my e-book of <br>
<i>Middlemarch </i>says I have the permission to copy only ten text selections <br>
into the memory every ten days, what that really means is that the <br>
eBook Reader has enabled the publisher to control how I use the book <br>
on my computer, far beyond the control that the law would enable. <br>
The control comes instead from the code&mdash;from the technology <br>
within which the e-book "lives." Though the e-book says that these are <br>
permissions, they are not the sort of "permissions" that most of us deal <br>
with. When a teenager gets "permission" to stay out till midnight, she <br>
knows (unless she's Cinderella) that she can stay out till 2 A. M., but <br>
will suffer a punishment if she's caught. But when the Adobe eBook <br>
Reader says I have the permission to make ten copies of the text into <br>
the computer's memory, that means that after I've made ten copies, the <br>
computer will not make any more. The same with the printing restric-tions: <br>
After ten pages, the eBook Reader will not print any more pages. <br>
It's the same with the silly restriction that says that you can't use the <br>
Read Aloud button to read my book aloud&mdash;it's not that the company <br>
will sue you if you do; instead, if you push the Read Aloud button with <br>
my book, the machine simply won't read aloud.

These are <i>controls, </i>not permissions. Imagine a world where the <br>
Marx Brothers sold word processing software that, when you tried to <br>
type "Warner Brothers," erased "Brothers" from the sentence. <br>
This is the future of copyright law: not so much copyright <i>law </i>as <br>
copyright <i>code. </i>The controls over access to content will not be controls <br>
that are ratified by courts; the controls over access to content will be <br>
controls that are coded by programmers. And whereas the controls that <br>
are built into the law are always to be checked by a judge, the controls <br>
that are built into the technology have no similar built-in check. <br>
How significant is this? Isn't it always possible to get around the <br>
controls built into the technology? Software used to be sold with tech-nologies <br>
that limited the ability of users to copy the software, but those <br>
were trivial protections to defeat. Why won't it be trivial to defeat these <br>
protections as well? <br>
We've only scratched the surface of this story. Return to the Adobe <br>
eBook Reader. <br>
Early in the life of the Adobe eBook Reader, Adobe suffered a pub-lic <br>
relations nightmare. Among the books that you could download for <br>
free on the Adobe site was a copy of <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. <br>
</i>This wonderful book is in the public domain. Yet when you clicked on <br>

</tt>Here was a public domain children's book that you were not al-lowed <br>
to copy, not allowed to lend, not allowed to give, and, as the "per-missions" <br>
indicated, not allowed to "read aloud"! <br>
The public relations nightmare attached to that final permission. <br>
For the text did not say that you were not permitted to use the Read <br>
Aloud button; it said you did not have the permission to read the book <br>
aloud. That led some people to think that Adobe was restricting the <br>
right of parents, for example, to read the book to their children, which <br>
seemed, to say the least, absurd. <br>
Adobe responded quickly that it was absurd to think that it was try-ing <br>
to restrict the right to read a book aloud. Obviously it was only re-stricting <br>
the ability to use the Read Aloud button to have the book read <br>
aloud. But the question Adobe never did answer is this: Would Adobe <br>
thus agree that a consumer was free to use software to hack around the <br>
restrictions built into the eBook Reader? If some company (call it <br>
Elcomsoft) developed a program to disable the technological protec-tion <br>
built into an Adobe eBook so that a blind person, say, could use a <br>
computer to read the book aloud, would Adobe agree that such a use of <br>
an eBook Reader was fair? Adobe didn't answer because the answer, <br>
however absurd it might seem, is no. <br>
The point is not to blame Adobe. Indeed, Adobe is among the most <br>
innovative companies developing strategies to balance open access to <br>
content with incentives for companies to innovate. But Adobe's tech-nology <br>
enables control, and Adobe has an incentive to defend this con-trol. <br>
That incentive is understandable, yet what it creates is often crazy. <br>
To see the point in a particularly absurd context, consider a favorite <br>
story of mine that makes the same point. <br>
Consider the robotic dog made by Sony named "Aibo." The Aibo <br>
learns tricks, cuddles, and follows you around. It eats only electricity <br>
and that doesn't leave that much of a mess (at least in your house). <br>
The Aibo is expensive and popular. Fans from around the world <br>
have set up clubs to trade stories. One fan in particular set up a Web <br>
site to enable information about the Aibo dog to be shared. This fan set 
165

<a href="#page167">167</a>
<br>
</p><p>
up aibopet. com (and aibohack. com, but that resolves to the same site), <br>
and on that site he provided information about how to teach an Aibo <br>
to do tricks in addition to the ones Sony had taught it. <br>
"Teach" here has a special meaning. Aibos are just cute computers. <br>
You teach a computer how to do something by programming it differ-ently. <br>
So to say that aibopet. com was giving information about how to <br>
teach the dog to do new tricks is just to say that aibopet. com was giv-ing <br>
information to users of the Aibo pet about how to hack their com-puter <br>
"dog" to make it do new tricks (thus, aibohack. com). <br>
If you're not a programmer or don't know many programmers, the <br>
word <i>hack </i>has a particularly unfriendly connotation. Nonprogrammers <br>
hack bushes or weeds. Nonprogrammers in horror movies do even <br>
worse. But to programmers, or coders, as I call them, <i>hack </i>is a much <br>
more positive term. <i>Hack </i>just means code that enables the program to <br>
do something it wasn't originally intended or enabled to do. If you buy <br>
a new printer for an old computer, you might find the old computer <br>
doesn't run, or "drive," the printer. If you discovered that, you'd later be <br>
happy to discover a hack on the Net by someone who has written a <br>
driver to enable the computer to drive the printer you just bought. <br>
Some hacks are easy. Some are unbelievably hard. Hackers as a <br>
community like to challenge themselves and others with increasingly <br>
difficult tasks. There's a certain respect that goes with the talent to hack <br>
well. There's a well-deserved respect that goes with the talent to hack <br>
ethically. <br>
The Aibo fan was displaying a bit of both when he hacked the pro-gram <br>
and offered to the world a bit of code that would enable the Aibo <br>
to dance jazz. The dog wasn't programmed to dance jazz. It was a <br>
clever bit of tinkering that turned the dog into a more talented creature <br>
than Sony had built. <br>
I've told this story in many contexts, both inside and outside the <br>
United States. Once I was asked by a puzzled member of the audience, <br>
is it permissible for a dog to dance jazz in the United States? We for-get <br>
that stories about the backcountry still flow across much of the <br>

world. So let's just be clear before we continue: It's not a crime any-where <br>
(anymore) to dance jazz. Nor is it a crime to teach your dog to <br>
dance jazz. Nor should it be a crime (though we don't have a lot to go <br>
on here) to teach your robot dog to dance jazz. Dancing jazz is a com-pletely <br>
legal activity. One imagines that the owner of aibopet. com <br>
thought, <i>What possible problem could there be with teaching a robot dog to <br>
dance? <br>
</i>Let's put the dog to sleep for a minute, and turn to a pony show&mdash;<br>
not literally a pony show, but rather a paper that a Princeton academic <br>
named Ed Felten prepared for a conference. This Princeton academic <br>
is well known and respected. He was hired by the government in the <br>
Microsoft case to test Microsoft's claims about what could and could <br>
not be done with its own code. In that trial, he demonstrated both his <br>
brilliance and his coolness. Under heavy badgering by Microsoft <br>
lawyers, Ed Felten stood his ground. He was not about to be bullied <br>
into being silent about something he knew very well. <br>
But Felten's bravery was really tested in April 2001. 22 He and a <br>
group of colleagues were working on a paper to be submitted at con-ference. <br>
The paper was intended to describe the weakness in an encryp-tion <br>
system being developed by the Secure Digital Music Initiative as <br>
a technique to control the distribution of music. <br>
The SDMI coalition had as its goal a technology to enable content <br>
owners to exercise much better control over their content than the In-ternet, <br>
as it originally stood, granted them. Using encryption, SDMI <br>
hoped to develop a standard that would allow the content owner to say <br>
"this music cannot be copied," and have a computer respect that com-mand. <br>
The technology was to be part of a "trusted system" of control <br>
that would get content owners to trust the system of the Internet much <br>
more. <br>
When SDMI thought it was close to a standard, it set up a compe-tition. <br>
In exchange for providing contestants with the code to an <br>
SDMI-encrypted bit of content, contestants were to try to crack it <br>
and, if they did, report the problems to the consortium. <br>

<br>
</p><p>
Felten and his team figured out the encryption system quickly. He <br>
and the team saw the weakness of this system as a type: Many encryp-tion <br>
systems would suffer the same weakness, and Felten and his team <br>
thought it worthwhile to point this out to those who study encryption. <br>
Let's review just what Felten was doing. Again, this is the United <br>
States. We have a principle of free speech. We have this principle not <br>
just because it is the law, but also because it is a really great idea. A <br>
strongly protected tradition of free speech is likely to encourage a wide <br>
range of criticism. That criticism is likely, in turn, to improve the sys-tems <br>
or people or ideas criticized. <br>
What Felten and his colleagues were doing was publishing a paper <br>
describing the weakness in a technology. They were not spreading free <br>
music, or building and deploying this technology. The paper was an <br>
academic essay, unintelligible to most people. But it clearly showed the <br>
weakness in the SDMI system, and why SDMI would not, as presently <br>
constituted, succeed. <br>
What links these two, aibopet. com and Felten, is the letters they <br>
then received. Aibopet. com received a letter from Sony about the <br>
aibopet. com hack. Though a jazz-dancing dog is perfectly legal, Sony <br>
wrote: <br>

And though an academic paper describing the weakness in a system <br>
of encryption should also be perfectly legal, Felten received a letter <br>

ted by the Agreement and could subject you and your research <br>
team to actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act <br>
(" DMCA"). <br>
</p><p>
In both cases, this weirdly Orwellian law was invoked to control the <br>
spread of information. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act made <br>
spreading such information an offense. <br>
The DMCA was enacted as a response to copyright owners' first fear <br>
about cyberspace. The fear was that copyright control was effectively <br>
dead; the response was to find technologies that might compensate. <br>
These new technologies would be copyright protection technologies&mdash;<br>
technologies to control the replication and distribution of copyrighted <br>
material. They were designed as <i>code </i>to modify the original <i>code </i>of the <br>
Internet, to reestablish some protection for copyright owners. <br>
The DMCA was a bit of law intended to back up the protection of <br>
this code designed to protect copyrighted material. It was, we could <br>
say, <i>legal code </i>intended to buttress <i>software code </i>which itself was in-tended <br>
to support the <i>legal code of copyright. <br>
</i>But the DMCA was not designed merely to protect copyrighted <br>
works to the extent copyright law protected them. Its protection, that <br>
is, did not end at the line that copyright law drew. The DMCA regu-lated <br>
devices that were designed to circumvent copyright protection <br>
measures. It was designed to ban those devices, whether or not the use <br>
of the copyrighted material made possible by that circumvention <br>
would have been a copyright violation. <br>
Aibopet. com and Felten make the point. The Aibo hack circum-vented <br>
a copyright protection system for the purpose of enabling the <br>
dog to dance jazz. That enablement no doubt involved the use of copy-righted <br>
material. But as aibopet. com's site was noncommercial, and the <br>
use did not enable subsequent copyright infringements, there's no doubt <br>
that aibopet. com's hack was fair use of Sony's copyrighted material. Yet <br>
fair use is not a defense to the DMCA. The question is not whether the <br>

<br>
</p><p>
use of the copyrighted material was a copyright violation. The question <br>
is whether a copyright protection system was circumvented. <br>
The threat against Felten was more attenuated, but it followed the <br>
same line of reasoning. By publishing a paper describing how a copy-right <br>
protection system could be circumvented, the RIAA lawyer sug-gested, <br>
Felten himself was distributing a circumvention technology. <br>
Thus, even though he was not himself infringing anyone's copyright, <br>
his academic paper was enabling others to infringe others' copyright. <br>
The bizarreness of these arguments is captured in a cartoon drawn <br>
in 1981 by Paul Conrad. At that time, a court in California had held <br>
that the VCR could be banned because it was a copyright-infringing <br>
technology: It enabled consumers to copy films without the permission <br>
of the copyright owner. No doubt there were uses of the technology <br>
that were legal: Fred Rogers, aka "Mr. Rogers," for example, had testi-fied <br>
in that case that he wanted people to feel free to tape <i>Mr. Rogers' <br>
Neighborhood. <br>
</i></p><p>
Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the <br>
"Neighborhood" at hours when some children cannot use it. I <br>
think that it's a real service to families to be able to record such <br>
programs and show them at appropriate times. I have always felt <br>
that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows <br>
people to tape the "Neighborhood" off-the-air, and I'm speak-ing <br>
for the "Neighborhood" because that's what I produce, <br>
that they then become much more active in the programming of <br>
their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people <br>
being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcast-ing <br>
has always been "You are an important person just the way <br>
you are. You can make healthy decisions." Maybe I'm going on <br>
too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be <br>
more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is <br>
important. 23 <br>

<br>

Even though there were uses that were legal, because there were <br>
some uses that were illegal, the court held the companies producing <br>
the VCR responsible. <br>
This led Conrad to draw the cartoon below, which we can adopt to <br>
the DMCA. <br>
No argument I have can top this picture, but let me try to get close. <br>
The anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA target copyright <br>
circumvention technologies. Circumvention technologies can be used <br>
for different ends. They can be used, for example, to enable massive pi-rating <br>
of copyrighted material&mdash;a bad end. Or they can be used to en-able <br>
the use of particular copyrighted materials in ways that would be <br>
considered fair use&mdash;a good end. <br>
A handgun can be used to shoot a police officer or a child. Most <br>

<br>
</p><p>
would agree such a use is bad. Or a handgun can be used for target <br>
practice or to protect against an intruder. At least some would say that <br>
such a use would be good. It, too, is a technology that has both good <br>
and bad uses. <br>
The obvious point of Conrad's cartoon is the weirdness of a world <br>
where guns are legal, despite the harm they can do, while VCRs (and <br>
circumvention technologies) are illegal. Flash: <i>No one ever died from <br>
copyright circumvention. </i>Yet the law bans circumvention technologies <br>
absolutely, despite the potential that they might do some good, but <br>
permits guns, despite the obvious and tragic harm they do. <br>
The Aibo and RIAA examples demonstrate how copyright owners <br>
are changing the balance that copyright law grants. Using code, copy-right <br>
owners restrict fair use; using the DMCA, they punish those who <br>
would attempt to evade the restrictions on fair use that they impose <br>
through code. Technology becomes a means by which fair use can be <br>
erased; the law of the DMCA backs up that erasing. <br>
This is how <i>code </i>becomes <i>law. </i>The controls built into the technology <br>
of copy and access protection become rules the violation of which is also <br>
a violation of the law. In this way, the code extends the law&mdash;increasing its <br>
regulation, even if the subject it regulates (activities that would otherwise <br>
plainly constitute fair use) is beyond the reach of the law. Code becomes <br>
law; code extends the law; code thus extends the control that copyright <br>
owners effect&mdash;at least for those copyright holders with the lawyers <br>
who can write the nasty letters that Felten and aibopet. com received. <br>
There is one final aspect of the interaction between architecture <br>
and law that contributes to the force of copyright's regulation. This is <br>
the ease with which infringements of the law can be detected. For <br>
contrary to the rhetoric common at the birth of cyberspace that on the <br>
Internet, no one knows you're a dog, increasingly, given changing tech-nologies <br>
deployed on the Internet, it is easy to find the dog who com-mitted <br>
a legal wrong. The technologies of the Internet are open to <br>
snoops as well as sharers, and the snoops are increasingly good at track-ing <br>
down the identity of those who violate the rules. <br>

For example, imagine you were part of a <i>Star Trek </i>fan club. You <br>
gathered every month to share trivia, and maybe to enact a kind of fan <br>
fiction about the show. One person would play Spock, another, Cap-tain <br>
Kirk. The characters would begin with a plot from a real story, <br>
then simply continue it. 24 <br>
Before the Internet, this was, in effect, a totally unregulated activ-ity. <br>
No matter what happened inside your club room, you would never <br>
be interfered with by the copyright police. You were free in that space <br>
to do as you wished with this part of our culture. You were allowed to <br>
build on it as you wished without fear of legal control. <br>
But if you moved your club onto the Internet, and made it generally <br>
available for others to join, the story would be very different. Bots scour-ing <br>
the Net for trademark and copyright infringement would quickly <br>
find your site. Your posting of fan fiction, depending upon the owner-ship <br>
of the series that you're depicting, could well inspire a lawyer's <br>
threat. And ignoring the lawyer's threat would be extremely costly in-deed. <br>
The law of copyright is extremely efficient. The penalties are se-vere, <br>
and the process is quick. <br>
This change in the effective force of the law is caused by a change <br>
in the ease with which the law can be enforced. That change too shifts <br>
the law's balance radically. It is as if your car transmitted the speed at <br>
which you traveled at every moment that you drove; that would be just <br>
one step before the state started issuing tickets based upon the data you <br>
transmitted. That is, in effect, what is happening here. <br>

<tt>Market: Concentration <br>
</tt>So copyright's duration has increased dramatically&mdash;tripled in the past <br>
thirty years. And copyright's scope has increased as well&mdash;from regu-lating <br>
only publishers to now regulating just about everyone. And <br>
copyright's reach has changed, as every action becomes a copy and <br>
hence presumptively regulated. And as technologists find better ways <br>

<br>
</p><p>
to control the use of content, and as copyright is increasingly enforced <br>
through technology, copyright's force changes, too. Misuse is easier to <br>
find and easier to control. This regulation of the creative process, which <br>
began as a tiny regulation governing a tiny part of the market for cre-ative <br>
work, has become the single most important regulator of creativ-ity <br>
there is. It is a massive expansion in the scope of the government's <br>
control over innovation and creativity; it would be totally unrecogniz-able <br>
to those who gave birth to copyright's control. <br>
Still, in my view, all of these changes would not matter much if it <br>
weren't for one more change that we must also consider. This is a <br>
change that is in some sense the most familiar, though its significance <br>
and scope are not well understood. It is the one that creates precisely the <br>
reason to be concerned about all the other changes I have described. <br>
This is the change in the concentration and integration of the media. <br>
In the past twenty years, the nature of media ownership has undergone <br>
a radical alteration, caused by changes in legal rules governing the me-dia. <br>
Before this change happened, the different forms of media were <br>
owned by separate media companies. Now, the media is increasingly <br>
owned by only a few companies. Indeed, after the changes that the <br>
FCC announced in June 2003, most expect that within a few years, we <br>
will live in a world where just three companies control more than 85 <br>
percent of the media. <br>
These changes are of two sorts: the scope of concentration, and its <br>
nature. <br>
Changes in scope are the easier ones to describe. As Senator John <br>
McCain summarized the data produced in the FCC's review of media <br>
ownership, "five companies control 85 percent of our media sources." 25 <br>
The five recording labels of Universal Music Group, BMG, Sony Mu-sic <br>
Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and EMI control 84.8 per-cent <br>
of the U. S. music market. 26 The "five largest cable companies pipe <br>
programming to 74 percent of the cable subscribers nationwide." 27 <br>
The story with radio is even more dramatic. Before deregulation, <br>
the nation's largest radio broadcasting conglomerate owned fewer than <br>

<br>

seventy-five stations. Today <i>one </i>company owns more than 1,200 stations. <br>
During that period of consolidation, the total number of radio owners <br>
dropped by 34 percent. Today, in most markets, the two largest broad-casters <br>
control 74 percent of that market's revenues. Overall, just four <br>
companies control 90 percent of the nation's radio advertising revenues. <br>
Newspaper ownership is becoming more concentrated as well. To-day, <br>
there are six hundred fewer daily newspapers in the United States <br>
than there were eighty years ago, and ten companies control half of the <br>
nation's circulation. There are twenty major newspaper publishers in <br>
the United States. The top ten film studios receive 99 percent of all <br>
film revenue. The ten largest cable companies account for 85 percent of <br>
all cable revenue. This is a market far from the free press the framers <br>
sought to protect. Indeed, it is a market that is quite well protected&mdash;<br>
by the market. <br>
Concentration in size alone is one thing. The more invidious <br>
change is in the nature of that concentration. As author James Fallows <br>
put it in a recent article about Rupert Murdoch, <br>
</p><p>
Murdoch's companies now constitute a production system un-matched <br>
in its integration. They supply content&mdash;Fox movies . . . <br>
Fox TV shows ... Fox-controlled sports broadcasts, plus newspa-pers <br>
and books. They sell the content to the public and to adver-tisers&mdash;<br>
in newspapers, on the broadcast network, on the cable <br>
channels. And they operate the physical distribution system <br>
through which the content reaches the customers. Murdoch's <br>
satellite systems now distribute News Corp. content in Europe <br>
and Asia; if Murdoch becomes DirecTV's largest single owner, <br>
that system will serve the same function in the United States. 28 <br>
</p><p>
The pattern with Murdoch is the pattern of modern media. Not <br>
just large companies owning many radio stations, but a few companies <br>
owning as many outlets of media as possible. A picture describes this <br>
pattern better than a thousand words could do: <br>

</p><p>
Does this concentration matter? Will it affect what is made, or <br>
what is distributed? Or is it merely a more efficient way to produce and <br>
distribute content? <br>
My view was that concentration wouldn't matter. I thought it was <br>
nothing more than a more efficient financial structure. But now, after <br>
reading and listening to a barrage of creators try to convince me to the <br>
contrary, I am beginning to change my mind. <br>
Here's a representative story that begins to suggest how this inte-gration <br>
may matter. <br>
In 1969, Norman Lear created a pilot for <i>All in the Family. </i>He took <br>
the pilot to ABC. The network didn't like it. It was too edgy, they told <br>
Lear. Make it again. Lear made a second pilot, more edgy than the <br>
first. ABC was exasperated. You're missing the point, they told Lear. <br>
We wanted less edgy, not more. <br>
Rather than comply, Lear simply took the show elsewhere. CBS <br>
was happy to have the series; ABC could not stop Lear from walking. <br>
The copyrights that Lear held assured an independence from network <br>
control. 29 <br>

<strong><a name="page177"> Page 177</a></strong>
<a href="#page178">178</a>
<br>

The network did not control those copyrights because the law for-bade <br>
the networks from controlling the content they syndicated. The <br>
law required a separation between the networks and the content pro-ducers; <br>
that separation would guarantee Lear freedom. And as late as <br>
1992, because of these rules, the vast majority of prime time televi-sion&mdash;<br>
75 percent of it&mdash;was "independent" of the networks. <br>
In 1994, the FCC abandoned the rules that required this inde-pendence. <br>
After that change, the networks quickly changed the balance. <br>
In 1985, there were twenty-five independent television production stu-dios; <br>
in 2002, only five independent television studios remained. "In <br>
1992, only 15 percent of new series were produced for a network by a <br>
company it controlled. Last year, the percentage of shows produced by <br>
controlled companies more than quintupled to 77 percent." "In 1992, <br>
16 new series were produced independently of conglomerate control, <br>
last year there was one." 30 In 2002, 75 percent of prime time television <br>
was owned by the networks that ran it. "In the ten-year period between <br>
1992 and 2002, the number of prime time television hours per week <br>
produced by network studios increased over 200%, whereas the num-ber <br>
of prime time television hours per week produced by independent <br>
studios decreased 63%." 31 <br>
Today, another Norman Lear with another <i>All in the Family </i>would <br>
find that he had the choice either to make the show less edgy or to be <br>
fired: The content of any show developed for a network is increasingly <br>
owned by the network. <br>
While the number of channels has increased dramatically, the own-ership <br>
of those channels has narrowed to an ever smaller and smaller <br>
few. As Barry Diller said to Bill Moyers, <br>
</p><p>
Well, if you have companies that produce, that finance, that air on <br>
their channel and then distribute worldwide everything that goes <br>
through their controlled distribution system, then what you get is <br>
fewer and fewer actual voices participating in the process. [We <br>

</p><p>
tion companies producing television programs. Now you have less <br>
than a handful. 32 <br>
</p><p>
This narrowing has an effect on what is produced. The product of <br>
such large and concentrated networks is increasingly homogenous. In-creasingly <br>
safe. Increasingly sterile. The product of news shows from <br>
networks like this is increasingly tailored to the message the network <br>
wants to convey. This is not the communist party, though from the in-side, <br>
it must feel a bit like the communist party. No one can question <br>
without risk of consequence&mdash;not necessarily banishment to Siberia, <br>
but punishment nonetheless. Independent, critical, different views are <br>
quashed. This is not the environment for a democracy. <br>
Economics itself offers a parallel that explains why this integration <br>
affects creativity. Clay Christensen has written about the "Innovator's <br>
Dilemma": the fact that large traditional firms find it rational to ignore <br>
new, breakthrough technologies that compete with their core business. <br>
The same analysis could help explain why large, traditional media <br>
companies would find it rational to ignore new cultural trends. 33 Lum-bering <br>
giants not only don't, but should not, sprint. Yet if the field is <br>
only open to the giants, there will be far too little sprinting. <br>
I don't think we know enough about the economics of the media <br>
market to say with certainty what concentration and integration will <br>
do. The efficiencies are important, and the effect on culture is hard to <br>
measure. <br>
But there is a quintessentially obvious example that does strongly <br>
suggest the concern. <br>
In addition to the copyright wars, we're in the middle of the drug <br>
wars. Government policy is strongly directed against the drug cartels; <br>
criminal and civil courts are filled with the consequences of this battle. <br>
Let me hereby disqualify myself from any possible appointment to <br>
any position in government by saying I believe this war is a profound <br>
mistake. I am not pro drugs. Indeed, I come from a family once <br>

wrecked by drugs&mdash;though the drugs that wrecked my family were all <br>
quite legal. I believe this war is a profound mistake because the collat-eral <br>
damage from it is so great as to make waging the war insane. <br>
When you add together the burdens on the criminal justice system, the <br>
desperation of generations of kids whose only real economic opportu-nities <br>
are as drug warriors, the queering of constitutional protections be-cause <br>
of the constant surveillance this war requires, and, most profoundly, <br>
the total destruction of the legal systems of many South American na-tions <br>
because of the power of the local drug cartels, I find it impossible <br>
to believe that the marginal benefit in reduced drug consumption by <br>
Americans could possibly outweigh these costs. <br>
You may not be convinced. That's fine. We live in a democracy, and <br>
it is through votes that we are to choose policy. But to do that, we de-pend <br>
fundamentally upon the press to help inform Americans about <br>
these issues. <br>
Beginning in 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy <br>
launched a media campaign as part of the "war on drugs." The cam-paign <br>
produced scores of short film clips about issues related to illegal <br>
drugs. In one series (the Nick and Norm series) two men are in a bar, <br>
discussing the idea of legalizing drugs as a way to avoid some of the <br>
collateral damage from the war. One advances an argument in favor of <br>
drug legalization. The other responds in a powerful and effective way <br>
against the argument of the first. In the end, the first guy changes his <br>
mind (hey, it's television). The plug at the end is a damning attack on <br>
the pro-legalization campaign. <br>
Fair enough. It's a good ad. Not terribly misleading. It delivers its <br>
message well. It's a fair and reasonable message. <br>
But let's say you think it is a wrong message, and you'd like to run a <br>
countercommercial. Say you want to run a series of ads that try to <br>
demonstrate the extraordinary collateral harm that comes from the <br>
drug war. Can you do it? <br>
Well, obviously, these ads cost lots of money. Assume you raise the <br>

money. Assume a group of concerned citizens donates all the money in <br>
the world to help you get your message out. Can you be sure your mes-sage <br>
will be heard then? <br>
No. You cannot. Television stations have a general policy of avoid-ing <br>
"controversial" ads. Ads sponsored by the government are deemed <br>
uncontroversial; ads disagreeing with the government are controversial. <br>
This selectivity might be thought inconsistent with the First Amend-ment, <br>
but the Supreme Court has held that stations have the right to <br>
choose what they run. Thus, the major channels of commercial media <br>
will refuse one side of a crucial debate the opportunity to present its case. <br>
And the courts will defend the rights of the stations to be this biased. 34 <br>
I'd be happy to defend the networks' rights, as well&mdash;if we lived in <br>
a media market that was truly diverse. But concentration in the media <br>
throws that condition into doubt. If a handful of companies control ac-cess <br>
to the media, and that handful of companies gets to decide which <br>
political positions it will allow to be promoted on its channels, then in <br>
an obvious and important way, concentration matters. You might like <br>
the positions the handful of companies selects. But you should not like <br>
a world in which a mere few get to decide which issues the rest of us <br>
get to know about. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Together <br>
</tt>There is something innocent and obvious about the claim of the copy-right <br>
warriors that the government should "protect my property." In <br>
the abstract, it is obviously true and, ordinarily, totally harmless. No <br>
sane sort who is not an anarchist could disagree. <br>
But when we see how dramatically this "property" has changed&mdash;<br>
when we recognize how it might now interact with both technology <br>
and markets to mean that the effective constraint on the liberty to cul-tivate <br>
our culture is dramatically different&mdash;the claim begins to seem <br>

the law's control, and (2) the power of concentrated markets <br>
to weaken the opportunity for dissent, if strictly enforcing the mas-sively <br>
expanded "property" rights granted by copyright fundamentally <br>
changes the freedom within this culture to cultivate and build upon our <br>
past, then we have to ask whether this property should be redefined. <br>
Not starkly. Or absolutely. My point is not that we should abolish <br>
copyright or go back to the eighteenth century. That would be a total <br>
mistake, disastrous for the most important creative enterprises within <br>
our culture today. <br>
But there is a space between zero and one, Internet culture notwith-standing. <br>
And these massive shifts in the effective power of copyright <br>
regulation, tied to increased concentration of the content industry and <br>
resting in the hands of technology that will increasingly enable control <br>
over the use of culture, should drive us to consider whether another ad-justment <br>
is called for. Not an adjustment that increases copyright's <br>
power. Not an adjustment that increases its term. Rather, an adjust-ment <br>
to restore the balance that has traditionally defined copyright's <br>
regulation&mdash;a weakening of that regulation, to strengthen creativity. <br>
Copyright law has not been a rock of Gibraltar. It's not a set of con-stant <br>
commitments that, for some mysterious reason, teenagers and <br>
geeks now flout. Instead, copyright power has grown dramatically in a <br>
short period of time, as the technologies of distribution and creation <br>
have changed and as lobbyists have pushed for more control by copy-right <br>
holders. Changes in the past in response to changes in technol-ogy <br>
suggest that we may well need similar changes in the future. And <br>
these changes have to be <i>reductions </i>in the scope of copyright, in re-sponse <br>
to the extraordinary increase in control that technology and the <br>
market enable. <br>
For the single point that is lost in this war on pirates is a point that <br>
we see only after surveying the range of these changes. When you add <br>
together the effect of changing law, concentrated markets, and chang-" <br>

ing technology, together they produce an astonishing conclusion: <br>
<i>Never in our history have fewer had a legal right to control more of the de-velopment <br>
of our culture than now. <br>
</i>Not when copyrights were perpetual, for when copyrights were <br>
perpetual, they affected only that precise creative work. Not when only <br>
publishers had the tools to publish, for the market then was much more <br>
diverse. Not when there were only three television networks, for even <br>
then, newspapers, film studios, radio stations, and publishers were in-dependent <br>
of the networks. <i>Never </i>has copyright protected such a wide <br>
range of rights, against as broad a range of actors, for a term that was <br>
remotely as long. This form of regulation&mdash;a tiny regulation of a tiny <br>
part of the creative energy of a nation at the founding&mdash;is now a mas-sive <br>
regulation of the overall creative process. Law plus technology plus <br>
the market now interact to turn this historically benign regulation into <br>
the most significant regulation of culture that our free society has <br>
known. 35 <br>
</p><p>
<tt>This has been </tt>a long chapter. Its point can now be briefly stated. <br>
At the start of this book, I distinguished between commercial and <br>
noncommercial culture. In the course of this chapter, I have distin-guished <br>
between copying a work and transforming it. We can now <br>
combine these two distinctions and draw a clear map of the changes <br>
that copyright law has undergone. <br>
In 1790, the law looked like this: <br>
</p><p>
<tt>170 </tt><b><tt>FREE </tt></b><tt>CULTURE <br>
</tt><b>PUBLISH TRANSFORM <br>
</b>Commercial © Free <br>
Noncommercial Free Free <br>

The act of publishing a map, chart, and book was regulated by <br>
copyright law. Nothing else was. Transformations were free. And as <br>

<tt>"PROPERTY" 171 <br>
</tt>to benefit commercially would register, copying through publishing of <br>
noncommercial work was also free. <br>
By the end of the nineteenth century, the law had changed to this: <br>
</p><p>
<b>PUBLISH TRANSFORM <br>
</b>Commercial © © <br>
Noncommercial Free Free <br>
</p><p>
Derivative works were now regulated by copyright law&mdash;if pub-lished, <br>
which again, given the economics of publishing at the time, <br>
means if offered commercially. But noncommercial publishing and <br>
transformation were still essentially free. <br>
In 1909 the law changed to regulate copies, not publishing, and af-ter <br>
this change, the scope of the law was tied to technology. As the <br>
technology of copying became more prevalent, the reach of the law ex-panded. <br>
Thus by 1975, as photocopying machines became more com-mon, <br>
we could say the law began to look like this: <br>
</p><p>
<b>COPY TRANSFORM <br>
</b>Commercial © © <br>
Noncommercial ©/ Free Free <br>
</p><p>
The law was interpreted to reach noncommercial copying through, <br>
say, copy machines, but still much of copying outside of the commer-cial <br>
market remained free. But the consequence of the emergence of <br>
digital technologies, especially in the context of a digital network, <br>
means that the law now looks like this: <br>
</p><p>
<b>COPY TRANSFORM <br>
</b>Commercial © © <br>
Noncommercial © © <br>
</p><p>
Every realm is governed by copyright law, whereas before most cre-ativity <br>
was not. The law now regulates the full range of creativity&mdash;

<tt>172 </tt><b><tt>FREE </tt></b><tt>CULTURE <br>
</tt>commercial or not, transformative or not&mdash;with the same rules designed <br>
to regulate commercial publishers. <br>
Obviously, copyright law is not the enemy. The enemy is regulation <br>
that does no good. So the question that we should be asking just now <br>
is whether extending the regulations of copyright law into each of <br>
these domains actually does any good. <br>
I have no doubt that it does good in regulating commercial copying. <br>
But I also have no doubt that it does more harm than good when <br>
regulating (as it regulates just now) noncommercial copying and, espe-cially, <br>
noncommercial transformation. And increasingly, for the rea-sons <br>
sketched especially in chapters 7 and 8, one might well wonder <br>
whether it does more harm than good for commercial transformation. <br>
More commercial transformative work would be created if derivative <br>
rights were more sharply restricted. <br>
The issue is therefore not simply whether copyright is property. Of <br>
course copyright is a kind of "property," and of course, as with any <br>
property, the state ought to protect it. But first impressions notwith-standing, <br>
historically, this property right (as with all property rights 36 ) <br>
has been crafted to balance the important need to give authors and <br>
artists incentives with the equally important need to assure access to <br>
creative work. This balance has always been struck in light of new tech-nologies. <br>
And for almost half of our tradition, the "copyright" did not <br>
control <i>at all </i>the freedom of others to build upon or transform a creative <br>
work. American culture was born free, and for almost 180 years our <br>
country consistently protected a vibrant and rich free culture. <br>
We achieved that free culture because our law respected important <br>
limits on the scope of the interests protected by "property." The very <br>
birth of "copyright" as a statutory right recognized those limits, by <br>
granting copyright owners protection for a limited time only (the story <br>
of chapter 6). The tradition of "fair use" is animated by a similar con-cern <br>
that is increasingly under strain as the costs of exercising any fair <br>
use right become unavoidably high (the story of chapter 7). Adding <br>
statutory rights where markets might stifle innovation is another famil-<br>

<br>

iar limit on the property right that copyright is (chapter 8). And grant-ing <br>
archives and libraries a broad freedom to collect, claims of property <br>
notwithstanding, is a crucial part of guaranteeing the soul of a culture <br>
(chapter 9). Free cultures, like free markets, are built with property. But <br>
the nature of the property that builds a free culture is very different <br>
from the extremist vision that dominates the debate today. <br>
Free culture is increasingly the casualty in this war on piracy. In re-sponse <br>
to a real, if not yet quantified, threat that the technologies of the <br>
Internet present to twentieth-century business models for producing <br>
and distributing culture, the law and technology are being transformed <br>
in a way that will undermine our tradition of free culture. The property <br>
right that is copyright is no longer the balanced right that it was, or <br>
was intended to be. The property right that is copyright has become <br>
unbalanced, tilted toward an extreme. The opportunity to create and <br>
transform becomes weakened in a world in which creation requires <br>
permission and creativity must check with a lawyer. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER ELEVEN: Chimera <br>
In a well-known </tt>short story by H. G. Wells, a mountain climber <br>
named Nunez trips (literally, down an ice slope) into an unknown and <br>
isolated valley in the Peruvian Andes. 1 The valley is extraordinarily <br>
beautiful, with "sweet water, pasture, an even climate, slopes of rich <br>
brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit." But the <br>
villagers are all blind. Nunez takes this as an opportunity. "In the <br>
Country of the Blind," he tells himself, "the One-Eyed Man is King." <br>
So he resolves to live with the villagers to explore life as a king. <br>
Things don't go quite as he planned. He tries to explain the idea of <br>
sight to the villagers. They don't understand. He tells them they are <br>
"blind." They don't have the word <i>blind. </i>They think he's just thick. In-deed, <br>
as they increasingly notice the things he can't do (hear the sound <br>
of grass being stepped on, for example), they increasingly try to control <br>
him. He, in turn, becomes increasingly frustrated. " 'You don't under-stand, <br>
' he cried, in a voice that was meant to be great and resolute, and <br>
which broke. 'You are blind and I can see. Leave me alone! ' " <br>

The villagers don't leave him alone. Nor do they see (so to speak) <br>
the virtue of his special power. Not even the ultimate target of his af-fection, <br>
a young woman who to him seems "the most beautiful thing in <br>
the whole of creation," understands the beauty of sight. Nunez's de-scription <br>
of what he sees "seemed to her the most poetical of fancies, <br>
and she listened to his description of the stars and the mountains and <br>
her own sweet white-lit beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence." <br>
"She did not believe," Wells tells us, and "she could only half under-stand, <br>
but she was mysteriously delighted." <br>
When Nunez announces his desire to marry his "mysteriously de-lighted" <br>
love, the father and the village object. "You see, my dear," her <br>
father instructs, "he's an idiot. He has delusions. He can't do anything <br>
right." They take Nunez to the village doctor. <br>
After a careful examination, the doctor gives his opinion. "His brain <br>
is affected," he reports. <br>
"What affects it?" the father asks. <br>
"Those queer things that are called the eyes ... are diseased ... in <br>
such a way as to affect his brain." <br>
The doctor continues: "I think I may say with reasonable certainty <br>
that in order to cure him completely, all that we need to do is a simple <br>
and easy surgical operation&mdash;namely, to remove these irritant bodies <br>
[the eyes]." <br>
"Thank Heaven for science!" says the father to the doctor. They in-form <br>
Nunez of this condition necessary for him to be allowed his bride. <br>
(You'll have to read the original to learn what happens in the end. I be-lieve <br>
in free culture, but never in giving away the end of a story.) <br>
</p><p>
<tt>It sometimes </tt>happens that the eggs of twins fuse in the mother's <br>
womb. That fusion produces a "chimera." A chimera is a single creature <br>
with two sets of DNA. The DNA in the blood, for example, might be <br>
different from the DNA of the skin. This possibility is an underused <br>

plot for murder mysteries. "But the DNA shows with 100 percent cer-tainty <br>
that she was not the person whose blood was at the scene. . . ." <br>
Before I had read about chimeras, I would have said they were im-possible. <br>
A single person can't have two sets of DNA. The very idea of <br>
DNA is that it is the code of an individual. Yet in fact, not only can two <br>
individuals have the same set of DNA (identical twins), but one person <br>
can have two different sets of DNA (a chimera). Our understanding of <br>
a "person" should reflect this reality. <br>
The more I work to understand the current struggle over copyright <br>
and culture, which I've sometimes called unfairly, and sometimes not <br>
unfairly enough, "the copyright wars," the more I think we're dealing <br>
with a chimera. For example, in the battle over the question "What is <br>
p2p file sharing?" both sides have it right, and both sides have it wrong. <br>
One side says, "File sharing is just like two kids taping each others' <br>
records&mdash;the sort of thing we've been doing for the last thirty years <br>
without any question at all." That's true, at least in part. When I tell my <br>
best friend to try out a new CD that I've bought, but rather than just <br>
send the CD, I point him to my p2p server, that is, in all relevant re-spects, <br>
just like what every executive in every recording company no <br>
doubt did as a kid: sharing music. <br>
But the description is also false in part. For when my p2p server is <br>
on a p2p network through which anyone can get access to my music, <br>
then sure, my friends can get access, but it stretches the meaning of <br>
"friends" beyond recognition to say "my ten thousand best friends" can <br>
get access. Whether or not sharing my music with my best friend is <br>
what "we have always been allowed to do," we have not always been al-lowed <br>
to share music with "our ten thousand best friends." <br>
Likewise, when the other side says, "File sharing is just like walking <br>
into a Tower Records and taking a CD off the shelf and walking out <br>
with it," that's true, at least in part. If, after Lyle Lovett (finally) re-leases <br>
a new album, rather than buying it, I go to Kazaa and find a free <br>
copy to take, that is very much like stealing a copy from Tower. <br>

<br>
</p><p>
But it is not quite stealing from Tower. After all, when I take a CD <br>
from Tower Records, Tower has one less CD to sell. And when I take <br>
a CD from Tower Records, I get a bit of plastic and a cover, and some-thing <br>
to show on my shelves. (And, while we're at it, we could also note <br>
that when I take a CD from Tower Records, the maximum fine that <br>
might be imposed on me, under California law, at least, is $1,000. Ac-cording <br>
to the RIAA, by contrast, if I download a ten-song CD, I'm li-able <br>
for $1,500,000 in damages.) <br>
The point is not that it is as neither side describes. The point is that <br>
it is both&mdash;both as the RIAA describes it and as Kazaa describes it. It <br>
is a chimera. And rather than simply denying what the other side as-serts, <br>
we need to begin to think about how we should respond to this <br>
chimera. What rules should govern it? <br>
We could respond by simply pretending that it is not a chimera. We <br>
could, with the RIAA, decide that every act of file sharing should be a <br>
felony. We could prosecute families for millions of dollars in damages <br>
just because file sharing occurred on a family computer. And we can get <br>
universities to monitor all computer traffic to make sure that no com-puter <br>
is used to commit this crime. These responses might be extreme, <br>
but each of them has either been proposed or actually implemented. 2 <br>
Alternatively, we could respond to file sharing the way many kids <br>
act as though we've responded. We could totally legalize it. Let there <br>
be no copyright liability, either civil or criminal, for making copy-righted <br>
content available on the Net. Make file sharing like gossip: reg-ulated, <br>
if at all, by social norms but not by law. <br>
Either response is possible. I think either would be a mistake. <br>
Rather than embrace one of these two extremes, we should embrace <br>
something that recognizes the truth in both. And while I end this book <br>
with a sketch of a system that does just that, my aim in the next chapter <br>
is to show just how awful it would be for us to adopt the zero-tolerance <br>
extreme. I believe <i>either </i>extreme would be worse than a reasonable al-ternative. <br>
But I believe the zero-tolerance solution would be the worse <br>
of the two extremes. <br>

<br>

Yet zero tolerance is increasingly our government's policy. In the <br>
middle of the chaos that the Internet has created, an extraordinary land <br>
grab is occurring. The law and technology are being shifted to give con-tent <br>
holders a kind of control over our culture that they have never had <br>
before. And in this extremism, many an opportunity for new inno-vation <br>
and new creativity will be lost. <br>
I'm not talking about the opportunities for kids to "steal" music. My <br>
focus instead is the commercial and cultural innovation that this war <br>
will also kill. We have never seen the power to innovate spread so <br>
broadly among our citizens, and we have just begun to see the innova-tion <br>
that this power will unleash. Yet the Internet has already seen the <br>
passing of one cycle of innovation around technologies to distribute <br>
content. The law is responsible for this passing. As the vice president <br>
for global public policy at one of these new innovators, eMusic. com, <br>
put it when criticizing the DMCA's added protection for copyrighted <br>
material, <br>
</p><p>
eMusic opposes music piracy. We are a distributor of copyrighted <br>
material, and we want to protect those rights. <br>
But building a technology fortress that locks in the clout of <br>
the major labels is by no means the only way to protect copyright <br>
interests, nor is it necessarily the best. It is simply too early to an-swer <br>
that question. Market forces operating naturally may very <br>
well produce a totally different industry model. <br>
This is a critical point. The choices that industry sectors make <br>
with respect to these systems will in many ways directly shape the <br>
market for digital media and the manner in which digital media <br>
are distributed. This in turn will directly influence the options <br>
that are available to consumers, both in terms of the ease with <br>
which they will be able to access digital media and the equipment <br>
that they will require to do so. Poor choices made this early in the <br>
game will retard the growth of this market, hurting everyone's <br>
interests. 3 <br>

<tt>CHAPTER TWELVE: Harms <br>
To fight </tt>"piracy," to protect "property," the content industry has <br>
launched a war. Lobbying and lots of campaign contributions have <br>
now brought the government into this war. As with any war, this one <br>
will have both direct and collateral damage. As with any war of prohi-bition, <br>
these damages will be suffered most by our own people. <br>
My aim so far has been to describe the consequences of this war, in <br>
particular, the consequences for "free culture." But my aim now is to ex-tend <br>
this description of consequences into an argument. Is this war jus-tified? <br>
</p><p>
In my view, it is not. There is no good reason why this time, for the <br>
first time, the law should defend the old against the new, just when the <br>
power of the property called "intellectual property" is at its greatest in <br>
our history. <br>
Yet "common sense" does not see it this way. Common sense is still <br>
on the side of the Causbys and the content industry. The extreme <br>
claims of control in the name of property still resonate; the uncritical <br>
rejection of "piracy" still has play. <br>

</p><p>
There will be many consequences of continuing this war. I want to <br>
describe just three. All three might be said to be unintended. I am quite <br>
confident the third is unintended. I'm less sure about the first two. The <br>
first two protect modern RCAs, but there is no Howard Armstrong in <br>
the wings to fight today's monopolists of culture. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Constraining Creators <br>
</tt>In the next ten years we will see an explosion of digital technologies. <br>
These technologies will enable almost anyone to capture and share <br>
content. Capturing and sharing content, of course, is what humans have <br>
done since the dawn of man. It is how we learn and communicate. But <br>
capturing and sharing through digital technology is different. The fi-delity <br>
and power are different. You could send an e-mail telling some-one <br>
about a joke you saw on Comedy Central, or you could send the <br>
clip. You could write an essay about the inconsistencies in the argu-ments <br>
of the politician you most love to hate, or you could make a short <br>
film that puts statement against statement. You could write a poem to <br>
express your love, or you could weave together a string&mdash;a mash-up&mdash;<br>
of songs from your favorite artists in a collage and make it available on <br>
the Net. <br>
This digital "capturing and sharing" is in part an extension of the <br>
capturing and sharing that has always been integral to our culture, and <br>
in part it is something new. It is continuous with the Kodak, but it ex-plodes <br>
the boundaries of Kodak-like technologies. The technology of <br>
digital "capturing and sharing" promises a world of extraordinarily di-verse <br>
creativity that can be easily and broadly shared. And as that cre-ativity <br>
is applied to democracy, it will enable a broad range of citizens <br>
to use technology to express and criticize and contribute to the culture <br>
all around. <br>
Tec hnology has thus given us an opportunity to do something with <br>
culture that has only ever been possible for individuals in small groups, <br>

isolated from others. Think about an old man telling a story to a col-lection <br>

extended across the globe. <br>
Yet all this is possible only if the activity is presumptively legal. In <br>
the current regime of legal regulation, it is not. Forget file sharing for <br>
a moment. Think about your favorite amazing sites on the Net. Web <br>
sites that offer plot summaries from forgotten television shows; sites <br>
that catalog cartoons from the 1960s; sites that mix images and sound <br>

work is presumptively illegal. <br>
That presumption will increasingly chill creativity, as the examples <br>
of extreme penalties for vague infringements continue to proliferate. It <br>
is impossible to get a clear sense of what's allowed and what's not, and at <br>
the same time, the penalties for crossing the line are astonishingly harsh. <br>
The four students who were threatened by the RIAA ( Jesse Jordan of <br>
chapter 3 was just one) were threatened with a $98 billion lawsuit for <br>
building search engines that permitted songs to be copied. Yet World-Com&mdash;<br>
which defrauded investors of $11 billion, resulting in a loss to in-vestors <br>
in market capitalization of over $200 billion&mdash;received a fine of a <br>
mere $750 million. 1 And under legislation being pushed in Congress <br>
right now, a doctor who negligently removes the wrong leg in an opera-tion <br>
would be liable for no more than $250,000 in damages for pain and <br>
suffering. 2 Can common sense recognize the absurdity in a world where <br>
the maximum fine for downloading two songs off the Internet is more <br>
than the fine for a doctor's negligently butchering a patient? <br>
The consequence of this legal uncertainty, tied to these extremely <br>
high penalties, is that an extraordinary amount of creativity will either <br>
never be exercised, or never be exercised in the open. We drive this cre-ative <br>
process underground by branding the modern-day Walt Disneys <br>
"pirates." We make it impossible for businesses to rely upon a public <br>
domain, because the boundaries of the public domain are designed to <br>

be unclear. It never pays to do anything except pay for the right to cre-ate, <br>
and hence only those who can pay are allowed to create. As was the <br>
case in the Soviet Union, though for very different reasons, we will be-gin <br>
to see a world of underground art&mdash;not because the message is nec-essarily <br>
political, or because the subject is controversial, but because the <br>
very act of creating the art is legally fraught. Already, exhibits of "ille-gal <br>
art" tour the United States. 3 In what does their "illegality" consist? <br>
In the act of mixing the culture around us with an expression that is <br>
critical or reflective. <br>
Part of the reason for this fear of illegality has to do with the chang-ing <br>
law. I described that change in detail in chapter 10. But an even <br>
bigger part has to do with the increasing ease with which infractions <br>
can be tracked. As users of file-sharing systems discovered in 2002, it <br>
is a trivial matter for copyright owners to get courts to order Internet <br>
service providers to reveal who has what content. It is as if your cassette <br>
tape player transmitted a list of the songs that you played in the privacy <br>
of your own home that anyone could tune into for whatever reason <br>
they chose. <br>
Never in our history has a painter had to worry about whether <br>
his painting infringed on someone else's work; but the modern-day <br>
painter, using the tools of Photoshop, sharing content on the Web, <br>
must worry all the time. Images are all around, but the only safe images <br>
to use in the act of creation are those purchased from Corbis or another <br>
image farm. And in purchasing, censoring happens. There is a free <br>
market in pencils; we needn't worry about its effect on creativity. But <br>
there is a highly regulated, monopolized market in cultural icons; the <br>
right to cultivate and transform them is not similarly free. <br>
Lawyers rarely see this because lawyers are rarely empirical. As I <br>
described in chapter 7, in response to the story about documentary <br>
filmmaker Jon Else, I have been lectured again and again by lawyers <br>
who insist Else's use was fair use, and hence I am wrong to say that the <br>
law regulates such a use. <br>

But fair use in America simply means the right to hire a lawyer to <br>
defend your right to create. And as lawyers love to forget, our system <br>
for defending rights such as fair use is astonishingly bad&mdash;in practically <br>
every context, but especially here. It costs too much, it delivers too <br>
slowly, and what it delivers often has little connection to the justice un-derlying <br>
the claim. The legal system may be tolerable for the very rich. <br>
For everyone else, it is an embarrassment to a tradition that prides it-self <br>
on the rule of law. <br>
Judges and lawyers can tell themselves that fair use provides ade-quate <br>
"breathing room" between regulation by the law and the access <br>
the law should allow. But it is a measure of how out of touch our legal <br>
system has become that anyone actually believes this. The rules that <br>
publishers impose upon writers, the rules that film distributors impose <br>
upon filmmakers, the rules that newspapers impose upon journalists&mdash;<br>
these are the real laws governing creativity. And these rules have little <br>
relationship to the "law" with which judges comfort themselves. <br>
For in a world that threatens $150,000 for a single willful infringe-ment <br>
of a copyright, and which demands tens of thousands of dollars to <br>
even defend against a copyright infringement claim, and which would <br>
never return to the wrongfully accused defendant anything of the costs <br>
she suffered to defend her right to speak&mdash;in that world, the astonish-ingly <br>
broad regulations that pass under the name "copyright" silence <br>
speech and creativity. And in that world, it takes a studied blindness for <br>
people to continue to believe they live in a culture that is free. <br>
As Jed Horovitz, the businessman behind Video Pipeline, said <br>
to me, <br>
</p><p>
We're losing [creative] opportunities right and left. Creative <br>
people are being forced not to express themselves. Thoughts are <br>

it still won't get distributed. Even if the stuff gets made ... you're <br>
not going to get it distributed in the mainstream media unless <br>

you've got a little note from a lawyer saying, "This has been <br>

of permission. That's the point at which they control it. <br>

<tt>Constraining Innovators <br>
</tt>The story of the last section was a crunchy-lefty story&mdash;creativity <br>
quashed, artists who can't speak, yada yada yada. Maybe that doesn't <br>
get you going. Maybe you think there's enough weird art out there, and <br>
enough expression that is critical of what seems to be just about every-thing. <br>
And if you think that, you might think there's little in this story <br>
to worry you. <br>
But there's an aspect of this story that is not lefty in any sense. In-deed, <br>
it is an aspect that could be written by the most extreme pro-market <br>
ideologue. And if you're one of these sorts (and a special one at <br>
that, 188 pages into a book like this), then you can see this other aspect <br>
by substituting "free market" every place I've spoken of "free culture." <br>
The point is the same, even if the interests affecting culture are more <br>
fundamental. <br>
The charge I've been making about the regulation of culture is the <br>
same charge free marketers make about regulating markets. Everyone, <br>
of course, concedes that some regulation of markets is necessary&mdash;at a <br>
minimum, we need rules of property and contract, and courts to en-force <br>
both. Likewise, in this culture debate, everyone concedes that at <br>
least some framework of copyright is also required. But both perspec-tives <br>
vehemently insist that just because some regulation is good, it <br>
doesn't follow that more regulation is better. And both perspectives are <br>
constantly attuned to the ways in which regulation simply enables the <br>
powerful industries of today to protect themselves against the com-petitors <br>
of tomorrow. <br>
This is the single most dramatic effect of the shift in regulatory <br>
strategy that I described in chapter 10. The consequence of this mas-188 <br>

sive threat of liability tied to the murky boundaries of copyright law is <br>
that innovators who want to innovate in this space can safely innovate <br>
only if they have the sign-off from last generation's dominant indus-tries. <br>
That lesson has been taught through a series of cases that were <br>
designed and executed to teach venture capitalists a lesson. That les-son&mdash;<br>
what former Napster CEO Hank Barry calls a "nuclear pall" that <br>
has fallen over the Valley&mdash;has been learned. <br>
Consider one example to make the point, a story whose beginning <br>
I told in <i>The Future of Ideas </i>and which has progressed in a way that <br>
even I (pessimist extraordinaire) would never have predicted. <br>
In 1997, Michael Roberts launched a company called MP3. com. <br>
MP3. com was keen to remake the music business. Their goal was not <br>
just to facilitate new ways to get access to content. Their goal was also <br>
to facilitate new ways to create content. Unlike the major labels, <br>
MP3. com offered creators a venue to distribute their creativity, with-out <br>
demanding an exclusive engagement from the creators. <br>
To make this system work, however, MP3. com needed a reliable <br>
way to recommend music to its users. The idea behind this alternative <br>
was to leverage the revealed preferences of music listeners to recom-mend <br>
new artists. If you like Lyle Lovett, you're likely to enjoy Bonnie <br>
Raitt. And so on. <br>
This idea required a simple way to gather data about user prefer-ences. <br>
MP3. com came up with an extraordinarily clever way to gather <br>
this preference data. In January 2000, the company launched a service <br>
called my. mp3. com. Using software provided by MP3. com, a user would <br>
sign into an account and then insert into her computer a CD. The soft-ware <br>
would identify the CD, and then give the user access to that con-tent. <br>
So, for example, if you inserted a CD by Jill Sobule, then <br>
wherever you were&mdash;at work or at home&mdash;you could get access to that <br>
music once you signed into your account. The system was therefore a <br>
kind of music-lockbox. <br>
No doubt some could use this system to illegally copy content. But <br>
that opportunity existed with or without MP3. com. The aim of the <br>

<br>
</p><p>
my. mp3. com service was to give users access to their own content, and <br>
as a by-product, by seeing the content they already owned, to discover <br>
the kind of content the users liked. <br>
To make this system function, however, MP3. com needed to copy <br>
50,000 CDs to a server. (In principle, it could have been the user who <br>
uploaded the music, but that would have taken a great deal of time, and <br>
would have produced a product of questionable quality.) It therefore <br>
purchased 50,000 CDs from a store, and started the process of making <br>
copies of those CDs. Again, it would not serve the content from those <br>
copies to anyone except those who authenticated that they had a copy <br>
of the CD they wanted to access. So while this was 50,000 copies, it <br>
was 50,000 copies directed at giving customers something they had al-ready <br>
bought. <br>
Nine days after MP3. com launched its service, the five major labels, <br>
headed by the RIAA, brought a lawsuit against MP3. com. MP3. com <br>
settled with four of the five. Nine months later, a federal judge found <br>
MP3. com to have been guilty of willful infringement with respect to <br>
the fifth. Applying the law as it is, the judge imposed a fine against <br>
MP3. com of $118 million. MP3. com then settled with the remaining <br>
plaintiff, Vivendi Universal, paying over $54 million. Vivendi pur-chased <br>
MP3. com just about a year later. <br>
That part of the story I have told before. Now consider its conclusion. <br>
After Vivendi purchased MP3. com, Vivendi turned around and <br>
filed a malpractice lawsuit against the lawyers who had advised it that <br>
they had a good faith claim that the service they wanted to offer would <br>
be considered legal under copyright law. This lawsuit alleged that it <br>
should have been obvious that the courts would find this behavior ille-gal; <br>
therefore, this lawsuit sought to punish any lawyer who had dared <br>
to suggest that the law was less restrictive than the labels demanded. <br>
The clear purpose of this lawsuit (which was settled for an unspec-ified <br>
amount shortly after the story was no longer covered in the press) <br>
was to send an unequivocal message to lawyers advising clients in this <br>
space: It is not just your clients who might suffer if the content indus-190 <br>

try directs its guns against them. It is also you. So those of you who be-lieve <br>
the law should be less restrictive should realize that such a view of <br>
the law will cost you and your firm dearly. <br>
This strategy is not just limited to the lawyers. In April 2003, <br>
Universal and EMI brought a lawsuit against Hummer Winblad, the <br>
venture capital firm (VC) that had funded Napster at a certain stage of <br>
its development, its cofounder ( John Hummer), and general partner <br>
(Hank Barry). 4 The claim here, as well, was that the VC should have <br>
recognized the right of the content industry to control how the indus-try <br>
should develop. They should be held personally liable for funding a <br>
company whose business turned out to be beyond the law. Here again, <br>
the aim of the lawsuit is transparent: Any VC now recognizes that if <br>
you fund a company whose business is not approved of by the dinosaurs, <br>
you are at risk not just in the marketplace, but in the courtroom as well. <br>
Your investment buys you not only a company, it also buys you a lawsuit. <br>
So extreme has the environment become that even car manufacturers <br>
are afraid of technologies that touch content. In an article in <i>Business <br>
2.0, </i>Rafe Needleman describes a discussion with BMW: <br>
</p><p>
I asked why, with all the storage capacity and computer power in <br>
the car, there was no way to play MP3 files. I was told that BMW <br>
engineers in Germany had rigged a new vehicle to play MP3s via <br>
the car's built-in sound system, but that the company's marketing <br>
and legal departments weren't comfortable with pushing this for-ward <br>
for release stateside. Even today, no new cars are sold in the <br>
United States with bona fide MP3 players. . . . 5 <br>

This is the world of the mafia&mdash;filled with "your money or your <br>
life" offers, governed in the end not by courts but by the threats that the <br>
law empowers copyright holders to exercise. It is a system that will ob-viously <br>
and necessarily stifle new innovation. It is hard enough to start <br>
a company. It is impossibly hard if that company is constantly threat-ened <br>
by litigation. <br>

The point is not that businesses should have a right to start illegal <br>
enterprises. The point is the definition of "illegal." The law is a mess of <br>
uncertainty. We have no good way to know how it should apply to new <br>
technologies. Yet by reversing our tradition of judicial deference, and <br>
by embracing the astonishingly high penalties that copyright law im-poses, <br>
that uncertainty now yields a reality which is far more conserv-ative <br>
than is right. If the law imposed the death penalty for parking <br>
tickets, we'd not only have fewer parking tickets, we'd also have much <br>
less driving. The same principle applies to innovation. If innovation is <br>
constantly checked by this uncertain and unlimited liability, we will <br>
have much less vibrant innovation and much less creativity. <br>
The point is directly parallel to the crunchy-lefty point about fair <br>
use. Whatever the "real" law is, realism about the effect of law in both <br>
contexts is the same. This wildly punitive system of regulation will sys-tematically <br>
stifle creativity and innovation. It will protect some indus-tries <br>
and some creators, but it will harm industry and creativity <br>
generally. Free market and free culture depend upon vibrant competi-tion. <br>
Yet the effect of the law today is to stifle just this kind of competi-tion. <br>
The effect is to produce an overregulated culture, just as the effect <br>
of too much control in the market is to produce an overregulated-regulated <br>
market. <br>
The building of a permission culture, rather than a free culture, is <br>
the first important way in which the changes I have described will bur-den <br>
innovation. A permission culture means a lawyer's culture&mdash;a cul-ture <br>
in which the ability to create requires a call to your lawyer. Again, <br>
I am not antilawyer, at least when they're kept in their proper place. I <br>
am certainly not antilaw. But our profession has lost the sense of its <br>
limits. And leaders in our profession have lost an appreciation of the <br>
high costs that our profession imposes upon others. The inefficiency of <br>
the law is an embarrassment to our tradition. And while I believe our <br>
profession should therefore do everything it can to make the law more <br>
efficient, it should at least do everything it can to limit the reach of the <br>

law where the law is not doing any good. The transaction costs buried <br>
within a permission culture are enough to bury a wide range of creativ-ity. <br>
Someone needs to do a lot of justifying to justify that result. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>The uncertainty </tt>of the law is one burden on innovation. There is <br>
a second burden that operates more directly. This is the effort by many <br>
in the content industry to use the law to directly regulate the technol-ogy <br>
of the Internet so that it better protects their content. <br>
The motivation for this response is obvious. The Internet enables <br>
the efficient spread of content. That efficiency is a feature of the Inter-net's <br>
design. But from the perspective of the content industry, this fea-ture <br>
is a "bug." The efficient spread of content means that content <br>
distributors have a harder time controlling the distribution of content. <br>
One obvious response to this efficiency is thus to make the Internet <br>
less efficient. If the Internet enables "piracy," then, this response says, <br>
we should break the kneecaps of the Internet. <br>
The examples of this form of legislation are many. At the urging of <br>
the content industry, some in Congress have threatened legislation that <br>
would require computers to determine whether the content they access <br>
is protected or not, and to disable the spread of protected content. 6 Con-gress <br>
has already launched proceedings to explore a mandatory "broad-cast <br>
flag" that would be required on any device capable of transmitting <br>
digital video (i. e., a computer), and that would disable the copying of <br>
any content that is marked with a broadcast flag. Other members of <br>
Congress have proposed immunizing content providers from liability <br>
for technology they might deploy that would hunt down copyright vi-olators <br>
and disable their machines. 7 <br>
In one sense, these solutions seem sensible. If the problem is the <br>
code, why not regulate the code to remove the problem. But any regu-lation <br>
of technical infrastructure will always be tuned to the particular <br>
technology of the day. It will impose significant burdens and costs on <br>

</p><p>
the technology, but will likely be eclipsed by advances around exactly <br>
those requirements. <br>
In March 2002, a broad coalition of technology companies, led by <br>
Intel, tried to get Congress to see the harm that such legislation would <br>
impose. 8 Their argument was obviously not that copyright should not <br>
be protected. Instead, they argued, any protection should not do more <br>
harm than good. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>There is one </tt>more obvious way in which this war has harmed in-novation&mdash;<br>
again, a story that will be quite familiar to the free market <br>
crowd. <br>
Copyright may be property, but like all property, it is also a form <br>
of regulation. It is a regulation that benefits some and harms others. <br>
When done right, it benefits creators and harms leeches. When done <br>
wrong, it is regulation the powerful use to defeat competitors. <br>
As I described in chapter 10, despite this feature of copyright as <br>
regulation, and subject to important qualifications outlined by Jessica <br>
Litman in her book <i>Digital Copyright, </i>9 overall this history of copyright <br>
is not bad. As chapter 10 details, when new technologies have come <br>
along, Congress has struck a balance to assure that the new is protected <br>
from the old. Compulsory, or statutory, licenses have been one part of <br>
that strategy. Free use (as in the case of the VCR) has been another. <br>
But that pattern of deference to new technologies has now changed <br>
with the rise of the Internet. Rather than striking a balance between <br>
the claims of a new technology and the legitimate rights of content <br>
creators, both the courts and Congress have imposed legal restrictions <br>
that will have the effect of smothering the new to benefit the old. <br>
The response by the courts has been fairly universal. 10 It has been <br>
mirrored in the responses threatened and actually implemented by <br>
Congress. I won't catalog all of those responses here. 11 But there is one <br>
example that captures the flavor of them all. This is the story of the de-mise <br>
of Internet radio. <br>

As I described in chapter 4, when a radio station plays a song, the <br>
recording artist doesn't get paid for that "radio performance" unless he <br>
or she is also the composer. So, for example if Marilyn Monroe had <br>
recorded a version of "Happy Birthday"&mdash;to memorialize her famous <br>
performance before President Kennedy at Madison Square Garden&mdash;<br>
then whenever that recording was played on the radio, the current copy-right <br>
owners of "Happy Birthday" would get some money, whereas <br>
Marilyn Monroe would not. <br>
The reasoning behind this balance struck by Congress makes some <br>
sense. The justification was that radio was a kind of advertising. The <br>
recording artist thus benefited because by playing her music, the radio <br>
station was making it more likely that her records would be purchased. <br>
Thus, the recording artist got something, even if only indirectly. Prob-ably <br>
this reasoning had less to do with the result than with the power <br>
of radio stations: Their lobbyists were quite good at stopping any ef-forts <br>
to get Congress to require compensation to the recording artists. <br>
Enter Internet radio. Like regular radio, Internet radio is a technol-ogy <br>
to stream content from a broadcaster to a listener. The broadcast <br>
travels across the Internet, not across the ether of radio spectrum. <br>
Thus, I can "tune in" to an Internet radio station in Berlin while sitting <br>
in San Francisco, even though there's no way for me to tune in to a reg-ular <br>
radio station much beyond the San Francisco metropolitan area. <br>
This feature of the architecture of Internet radio means that there <br>
are potentially an unlimited number of radio stations that a user could <br>
tune in to using her computer, whereas under the existing architecture <br>
for broadcast radio, there is an obvious limit to the number of broad-casters <br>
and clear broadcast frequencies. Internet radio could therefore <br>
be more competitive than regular radio; it could provide a wider range <br>
of selections. And because the potential audience for Internet radio is <br>
the whole world, niche stations could easily develop and market their <br>
content to a relatively large number of users worldwide. According to <br>
some estimates, more than eighty million users worldwide have tuned <br>
in to this new form of radio. <br>

Internet radio is thus to radio what FM was to AM. It is an im-provement <br>
potentially vastly more significant than the FM improve-ment <br>
over AM, since not only is the technology better, so, too, is the <br>
competition. Indeed, there is a direct parallel between the fight to es-tablish <br>
FM radio and the fight to protect Internet radio. As one author <br>
describes Howard Armstrong's struggle to enable FM radio, <br>
</p><p>
An almost unlimited number of FM stations was possible in the <br>
shortwaves, thus ending the unnatural restrictions imposed on ra-dio <br>
in the crowded longwaves. If FM were freely developed, the <br>
number of stations would be limited only by economics and com-petition <br>
rather than by technical restrictions. ... Armstrong <br>
likened the situation that had grown up in radio to that following <br>
the invention of the printing press, when governments and ruling <br>
interests attempted to control this new instrument of mass com-munications <br>
by imposing restrictive licenses on it. This tyranny <br>
was broken only when it became possible for men freely to ac-quire <br>
printing presses and freely to run them. FM in this sense <br>
was as great an invention as the printing presses, for it gave radio <br>
the opportunity to strike off its shackles. 12 <br>
</p><p>
This potential for FM radio was never realized&mdash;not because Arm-strong <br>
was wrong about the technology, but because he underestimated <br>
the power of "vested interests, habits, customs and legislation" 13 to re-tard <br>
the growth of this competing technology. <br>
Now the very same claim could be made about Internet radio. For <br>
again, there is no technical limitation that could restrict the number of <br>
Internet radio stations. The only restrictions on Internet radio are <br>
those imposed by the law. Copyright law is one such law. So the first <br>
question we should ask is, what copyright rules would govern Internet <br>
radio? <br>
But here the power of the lobbyists is reversed. Internet radio is a <br>
new industry. The recording artists, on the other hand, have a very <br>

powerful lobby, the RIAA. Thus when Congress considered the phe-nomenon <br>
of Internet radio in 1995, the lobbyists had primed Congress <br>
to adopt a different rule for Internet radio than the rule that applies to <br>
terrestrial radio. While terrestrial radio does not have to pay our hypo-thetical <br>
Marilyn Monroe when it plays her hypothetical recording of <br>
"Happy Birthday" on the air, <i>Internet radio does. </i>Not only is the law not <br>
neutral toward Internet radio&mdash;the law actually burdens Internet radio <br>
more than it burdens terrestrial radio. <br>
This financial burden is not slight. As Harvard law professor <br>
William Fisher estimates, if an Internet radio station distributed ad-free <br>
popular music to (on average) ten thousand listeners, twenty-four <br>
hours a day, the total artist fees that radio station would owe would be <br>
over $1 million a year. 14 A regular radio station broadcasting the same <br>
content would pay no equivalent fee. <br>
The burden is not financial only. Under the original rules that were <br>
proposed, an Internet radio station (but not a terrestrial radio station) <br>
would have to collect the following data from <i>every listening transaction: <br>
</i></p><p>
1. name of the service; <br>
2. channel of the program (AM/ FM stations use station ID); <br>
3. type of program (archived/ looped/ live); <br>
4. date of transmission; <br>
5. time of transmission; <br>
6. time zone of origination of transmission; <br>
7. numeric designation of the place of the sound recording <br>
within the program; <br>
8. duration of transmission (to nearest second); <br>
9. sound recording title; <br>
10. ISRC code of the recording; <br>
11. release year of the album per copyright notice and in the case <br>
of compilation albums, the release year of the album and copy-right <br>
date of the track; <br>

The Librarian of Congress eventually suspended these reporting <br>
requirements, pending further study. And he also changed the original <br>
rates set by the arbitration panel charged with setting rates. But the <br>
basic difference between Internet radio and terrestrial radio remains: <br>
Internet radio has to pay a <i>type of copyright fee </i>that terrestrial radio <br>
does not. <br>
Why? What justifies this difference? Was there any study of the <br>
economic consequences from Internet radio that would justify these <br>
differences? Was the motive to protect artists against piracy? <br>
In a rare bit of candor, one RIAA expert admitted what seemed ob-vious <br>
to everyone at the time. As Alex Alben, vice president for Public <br>
Policy at Real Networks, told me, <br>
</p><p>
The RIAA, which was representing the record labels, presented <br>
some testimony about what they thought a willing buyer would <br>
pay to a willing seller, and it was much higher. It was ten times <br>
higher than what radio stations pay to perform the same songs for <br>
the same period of time. And so the attorneys representing the <br>
webcasters asked the RIAA, ..." How do you come up with a <br>

rate that's so much higher? Why is it worth more than radio? Be-cause <br>
here we have hundreds of thousands of webcasters who <br>
want to pay, and that should establish the market rate, and if you <br>
set the rate so high, you're going to drive the small webcasters out <br>
of business. . . ." <br>
And the RIAA experts said, "Well, we don't really model this <br>
as an industry with thousands of webcasters, <i>we think it should be <br>
an industry with, you know, five or seven big players who can pay a <br>
high rate and it's a stable, predictable market." </i>(Emphasis added.) <br>

Translation: The aim is to use the law to eliminate competition, so <br>
that this platform of potentially immense competition, which would <br>
cause the diversity and range of content available to explode, would not <br>
cause pain to the dinosaurs of old. There is no one, on either the right <br>
or the left, who should endorse this use of the law. And yet there is <br>
practically no one, on either the right or the left, who is doing anything <br>

<tt>Corrupting Citizens <br>
</tt>Overregulation stifles creativity. It smothers innovation. It gives di-nosaurs <br>
a veto over the future. It wastes the extraordinary opportunity <br>
for a democratic creativity that digital technology enables. <br>
In addition to these important harms, there is one more that was <br>
important to our forebears, but seems forgotten today. Overregulation <br>
corrupts citizens and weakens the rule of law. <br>
The war that is being waged today is a war of prohibition. As with <br>
every war of prohibition, it is targeted against the behavior of a very <br>
large number of citizens. According to <i>The New York Times, </i>43 million <br>
Americans downloaded music in May 2002. 15 According to the RIAA, <br>
the behavior of those 43 million Americans is a felony. We thus have a <br>
set of rules that transform 20 percent of America into criminals. As the <br>

RIAA launches lawsuits against not only the Napsters and Kazaas of <br>
the world, but against students building search engines, and increas-ingly <br>
against ordinary users downloading content, the technologies for <br>
sharing will advance to further protect and hide illegal use. It is an arms <br>
race or a civil war, with the extremes of one side inviting a more ex-treme <br>
response by the other. <br>
The content industry's tactics exploit the failings of the American <br>
legal system. When the RIAA brought suit against Jesse Jordan, it <br>
knew that in Jordan it had found a scapegoat, not a defendant. The <br>
threat of having to pay either all the money in the world in damages <br>
($ 15,000,000) or almost all the money in the world to defend against <br>
paying all the money in the world in damages ($ 250,000 in legal fees) <br>
led Jordan to choose to pay all the money he had in the world <br>
($ 12,000) to make the suit go away. The same strategy animates the <br>
RIAA's suits against individual users. In September 2003, the RIAA <br>
sued 261 individuals&mdash;including a twelve-year-old girl living in public <br>
housing and a seventy-year-old man who had no idea what file sharing <br>
was. 16 As these scapegoats discovered, it will always cost more to de-fend <br>
against these suits than it would cost to simply settle. (The twelve <br>
year old, for example, like Jesse Jordan, paid her life savings of $2,000 <br>
to settle the case.) Our law is an awful system for defending rights. It <br>
is an embarrassment to our tradition. And the consequence of our law <br>
as it is, is that those with the power can use the law to quash any rights <br>
they oppose. <br>
Wars of prohibition are nothing new in America. This one is just <br>
something more extreme than anything we've seen before. We experi-mented <br>
with alcohol prohibition, at a time when the per capita con-sumption <br>
of alcohol was 1.5 gallons per capita per year. The war against <br>
drinking initially reduced that consumption to just 30 percent of its <br>
preprohibition levels, but by the end of prohibition, consumption was <br>
up to 70 percent of the preprohibition level. Americans were drinking <br>
just about as much, but now, a vast number were criminals. 17 We have <br>

launched a war on drugs aimed at reducing the consumption of regu-lated <br>
narcotics that 7 percent (or 16 million) Americans now use. 18 <br>
That is a drop from the high (so to speak) in 1979 of 14 percent of the <br>
population. We regulate automobiles to the point where the vast ma-jority <br>
of Americans violate the law every day. We run such a complex <br>
tax system that a majority of cash businesses regularly cheat. 19 We <br>
pride ourselves on our "free society," but an endless array of ordinary <br>
behavior is regulated within our society. And as a result, a huge pro-portion <br>
of Americans regularly violate at least some law. <br>
This state of affairs is not without consequence. It is a particularly <br>
salient issue for teachers like me, whose job it is to teach law students <br>
about the importance of "ethics." As my colleague Charlie Nesson told <br>
a class at Stanford, each year law schools admit thousands of students <br>
who have illegally downloaded music, illegally consumed alcohol and <br>
sometimes drugs, illegally worked without paying taxes, illegally driven <br>
cars. These are kids for whom behaving illegally is increasingly the <br>
norm. And then we, as law professors, are supposed to teach them how <br>
to behave ethically&mdash;how to say no to bribes, or keep client funds sep-arate, <br>
or honor a demand to disclose a document that will mean that <br>
your case is over. Generations of Americans&mdash;more significantly in <br>
some parts of America than in others, but still, everywhere in America <br>
today&mdash;can't live their lives both normally and legally, since "normally" <br>
entails a certain degree of illegality. <br>
The response to this general illegality is either to enforce the law <br>
more severely or to change the law. We, as a society, have to learn how <br>
to make that choice more rationally. Whether a law makes sense de-pends, <br>
in part, at least, upon whether the costs of the law, both in-tended <br>
and collateral, outweigh the benefits. If the costs, intended and <br>
collateral, do outweigh the benefits, then the law ought to be changed. <br>
Alternatively, if the costs of the existing system are much greater than <br>
the costs of an alternative, then we have a good reason to consider the <br>
alternative. <br>

My point is not the idiotic one: Just because people violate a law, we <br>
should therefore repeal it. Obviously, we could reduce murder statistics <br>
dramatically by legalizing murder on Wednesdays and Fridays. But <br>
that wouldn't make any sense, since murder is wrong every day of the <br>
week. A society is right to ban murder always and everywhere. <br>
My point is instead one that democracies understood for gen-erations, <br>
but that we recently have learned to forget. The rule of law <br>
depends upon people obeying the law. The more often, and more re-peatedly, <br>
we as citizens experience violating the law, the less we respect <br>
the law. Obviously, in most cases, the important issue is the law, not <br>
respect for the law. I don't care whether the rapist respects the law or <br>
not; I want to catch and incarcerate the rapist. But I do care whether <br>
my students respect the law. And I do care if the rules of law sow in-creasing <br>
disrespect because of the extreme of regulation they impose. <br>
Twenty million Americans have come of age since the Internet intro-duced <br>
this different idea of "sharing." We need to be able to call these <br>
twenty million Americans "citizens," not "felons." <br>
When at least forty-three million citizens download content from <br>
the Internet, and when they use tools to combine that content in ways <br>
unauthorized by copyright holders, the first question we should be ask-ing <br>
is not how best to involve the FBI. The first question should be <br>
whether this particular prohibition is really necessary in order to achieve <br>
the proper ends that copyright law serves. Is there another way to <br>
assure that artists get paid without transforming forty-three million <br>
Americans into felons? Does it make sense if there are other ways to <br>
assure that artists get paid without transforming America into a nation <br>
of felons? <br>
This abstract point can be made more clear with a particular example. <br>
We all own CDs. Many of us still own phonograph records. These <br>
pieces of plastic encode music that in a certain sense we have bought. <br>
The law protects our right to buy and sell that plastic: It is not a copy-right <br>
infringement for me to sell all my classical records at a used <br>

record store and buy jazz records to replace them. That "use" of the <br>
recordings is free. <br>
But as the MP3 craze has demonstrated, there is another use of <br>
phonograph records that is effectively free. Because these recordings <br>
were made without copy-protection technologies, I am "free" to copy, <br>
or "rip," music from my records onto a computer hard disk. Indeed, <br>
Apple Corporation went so far as to suggest that "freedom" was a right: <br>
In a series of commercials, Apple endorsed the "Rip, Mix, Burn" ca-pacities <br>
of digital technologies. <br>
This "use" of my records is certainly valuable. I have begun a large <br>
process at home of ripping all of my and my wife's CDs, and storing <br>
them in one archive. Then, using Apple's iTunes, or a wonderful pro-gram <br>
called Andromeda, we can build different play lists of our music: <br>
Bach, Baroque, Love Songs, Love Songs of Significant Others&mdash;the <br>
potential is endless. And by reducing the costs of mixing play lists, <br>
these technologies help build a creativity with play lists that is itself in-dependently <br>
valuable. Compilations of songs are creative and mean-ingful <br>
in their own right. <br>
This use is enabled by unprotected media&mdash;either CDs or records. <br>
But unprotected media also enable file sharing. File sharing threatens <br>
(or so the content industry believes) the ability of creators to earn a fair <br>
return from their creativity. And thus, many are beginning to experi-ment <br>
with technologies to eliminate unprotected media. These tech-nologies, <br>
for example, would enable CDs that could not be ripped. Or <br>
they might enable spy programs to identify ripped content on people's <br>
machines. <br>
If these technologies took off, then the building of large archives of <br>
your own music would become quite difficult. You might hang in <br>
hacker circles, and get technology to disable the technologies that pro-tect <br>
the content. Trading in those technologies is illegal, but maybe that <br>
doesn't bother you much. In any case, for the vast majority of people, <br>
these protection technologies would effectively destroy the archiving <br>

use of CDs. The technology, in other words, would force us all back to <br>
the world where we either listened to music by manipulating pieces of <br>
plastic or were part of a massively complex "digital rights manage-ment" <br>
system. <br>
If the only way to assure that artists get paid were the elimination <br>
of the ability to freely move content, then these technologies to inter-fere <br>
with the freedom to move content would be justifiable. But what <br>
if there were another way to assure that artists are paid, without lock-ing <br>
down any content? What if, in other words, a different system <br>
could assure compensation to artists while also preserving the freedom <br>
to move content easily? <br>
My point just now is not to prove that there is such a system. I of-fer <br>
a version of such a system in the last chapter of this book. For now, <br>
the only point is the relatively uncontroversial one: If a different system <br>
achieved the same legitimate objectives that the existing copyright sys-tem <br>
achieved, but left consumers and creators much more free, then <br>
we'd have a very good reason to pursue this alternative&mdash;namely, free-dom. <br>
The choice, in other words, would not be between property and <br>
piracy; the choice would be between different property systems and the <br>
freedoms each allowed. <br>
I believe there is a way to assure that artists are paid without turn-ing <br>
forty-three million Americans into felons. But the salient feature <br>
of this alternative is that it would lead to a very different market for <br>
producing and distributing creativity. The dominant few, who today <br>
control the vast majority of the distribution of content in the world, <br>
would no longer exercise this extreme of control. Rather, they would go <br>
the way of the horse-drawn buggy. <br>
Except that this generation's buggy manufacturers have already <br>
saddled Congress, and are riding the law to protect themselves against <br>
this new form of competition. For them the choice is between forty-three <br>
million Americans as criminals and their own survival. <br>
It is understandable why they choose as they do. It is not under-standable <br>
why we as a democracy continue to choose as we do. Jack <br>

Valenti is charming; but not so charming as to justify giving up a tra-dition <br>
as deep and important as our tradition of free culture. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>There's one more </tt>aspect to this corruption that is particularly im-portant <br>
to civil liberties, and follows directly from any war of prohibi-tion. <br>
As Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Fred von Lohmann <br>
describes, this is the "collateral damage" that "arises whenever you turn <br>
a very large percentage of the population into criminals." This is the <br>
collateral damage to civil liberties generally. <br>
"If you can treat someone as a putative lawbreaker," von Lohmann <br>
explains, <br>
</p><p>
then all of a sudden a lot of basic civil liberty protections evapo-rate <br>
to one degree or another.... If you're a copyright infringer, <br>
how can you hope to have any privacy rights? If you're a copyright <br>
infringer, how can you hope to be secure against seizures of your <br>
computer? How can you hope to continue to receive Internet <br>
access? ... Our sensibilities change as soon as we think, "Oh, <br>
well, but that person's a criminal, a lawbreaker." Well, what this <br>
campaign against file sharing has done is turn a remarkable per-centage <br>
of the American Internet-using population into "law-breakers." <br>
</p><p>
And the consequence of this transformation of the American public <br>
into criminals is that it becomes trivial, as a matter of due process, to <br>
effectively erase much of the privacy most would presume. <br>
Users of the Internet began to see this generally in 2003 as the <br>
RIAA launched its campaign to force Internet service providers to turn <br>
over the names of customers who the RIAA believed were violating <br>
copyright law. Verizon fought that demand and lost. With a simple re-quest <br>
to a judge, and without any notice to the customer at all, the <br>
identity of an Internet user is revealed. <br>

<br>
</p><p>
The RIAA then expanded this campaign, by announcing a general <br>
strategy to sue individual users of the Internet who are alleged to have <br>
downloaded copyrighted music from file-sharing systems. But as we've <br>
seen, the potential damages from these suits are astronomical: If a fam-ily's <br>
computer is used to download a single CD's worth of music, the <br>
family could be liable for $2 million in damages. That didn't stop the <br>
RIAA from suing a number of these families, just as they had sued <br>
Jesse Jordan. 20 <br>
Even this understates the espionage that is being waged by the <br>
RIAA. A report from CNN late last summer described a strategy the <br>
RIAA had adopted to track Napster users. 21 Using a sophisticated <br>
hashing algorithm, the RIAA took what is in effect a fingerprint of <br>
every song in the Napster catalog. Any copy of one of those MP3s will <br>
have the same "fingerprint." <br>
So imagine the following not-implausible scenario: Imagine a <br>
friend gives a CD to your daughter&mdash;a collection of songs just like the <br>
cassettes you used to make as a kid. You don't know, and neither does <br>
your daughter, where these songs came from. But she copies these <br>
songs onto her computer. She then takes her computer to college and <br>
connects it to a college network, and if the college network is "cooper-ating" <br>
with the RIAA's espionage, and she hasn't properly protected <br>
her content from the network (do you know how to do that yourself ?), <br>
then the RIAA will be able to identify your daughter as a "criminal." <br>
And under the rules that universities are beginning to deploy, 22 your <br>
daughter can lose the right to use the university's computer network. <br>
She can, in some cases, be expelled. <br>
Now, of course, she'll have the right to defend herself. You can hire <br>
a lawyer for her (at $300 per hour, if you're lucky), and she can plead <br>
that she didn't know anything about the source of the songs or that <br>
they came from Napster. And it may well be that the university believes <br>
her. But the university might not believe her. It might treat this "con-traband" <br>
as presumptive of guilt. And as any number of college students <br>

have already learned, our presumptions about innocence disappear in <br>
the middle of wars of prohibition. This war is no different. <br>
Says von Lohmann, <br>
</p><p>
So when we're talking about numbers like forty to sixty million <br>
Americans that are essentially copyright infringers, you create a <br>
situation where the civil liberties of those people are very much in <br>
peril in a general matter. [I don't] think [there is any] analog <br>
where you could randomly choose any person off the street and be <br>
confident that they were committing an unlawful act that could <br>
put them on the hook for potential felony liability or hundreds of <br>
millions of dollars of civil liability. Certainly we all speed, but <br>
speeding isn't the kind of an act for which we routinely forfeit <br>
civil liberties. Some people use drugs, and I think that's the clos-est <br>
analog, [but] many have noted that the war against drugs has <br>
eroded all of our civil liberties because it's treated so many Amer-icans <br>
as criminals. Well, I think it's fair to say that file sharing <br>
is an order of magnitude larger number of Americans than drug <br>
use. ... If forty to sixty million Americans have become law-breakers, <br>
then we're really on a slippery slope to lose a lot of civil <br>
liberties for all forty to sixty million of them. <br>
</p><p>
When forty to sixty million Americans are considered "criminals" <br>
under the law, and when the law could achieve the same objective&mdash;<br>
securing rights to authors&mdash;without these millions being considered <br>
"criminals," who is the villain? Americans or the law? Which is Amer-ican, <br>
a constant war on our own people or a concerted effort through <br>
our democracy to change our law? <br>

<tt>So here's </tt>the picture: You're standing at the side of the road. Your <br>
car is on fire. You are angry and upset because in part you helped start <br>
the fire. Now you don't know how to put it out. Next to you is a bucket, <br>
filled with gasoline. Obviously, gasoline won't put the fire out. <br>
As you ponder the mess, someone else comes along. In a panic, she <br>
grabs the bucket. Before you have a chance to tell her to stop&mdash;or be-fore <br>
she understands just why she should stop&mdash;the bucket is in the air. <br>
The gasoline is about to hit the blazing car. And the fire that gasoline <br>
will ignite is about to ignite everything around. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>A war </tt>about copyright rages all around&mdash;and we're all focusing on the <br>
wrong thing. No doubt, current technologies threaten existing busi-nesses. <br>
No doubt they may threaten artists. But technologies change. <br>
The industry and technologists have plenty of ways to use technology <br>
to protect themselves against the current threats of the Internet. This <br>
is a fire that if let alone would burn itself out. <br>

Yet policy makers are not willing to leave this fire to itself. Primed <br>
with plenty of lobbyists' money, they are keen to intervene to eliminate <br>
the problem they perceive. But the problem they perceive is not the real <br>
threat this culture faces. For while we watch this small fire in the cor-ner, <br>
there is a massive change in the way culture is made that is hap-pening <br>
all around. <br>
Somehow we have to find a way to turn attention to this more im-portant <br>
and fundamental issue. Somehow we have to find a way to <br>
avoid pouring gasoline onto this fire. <br>
We have not found that way yet. Instead, we seem trapped in a sim-pler, <br>
binary view. However much many people push to frame this de-bate <br>
more broadly, it is the simple, binary view that remains. We <br>
rubberneck to look at the fire when we should be keeping our eyes on <br>
the road. <br>
This challenge has been my life these last few years. It has also been <br>
my failure. In the two chapters that follow, I describe one small brace <br>
of efforts, so far failed, to find a way to refocus this debate. We must <br>
understand these failures if we're to understand what success will re-quire. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Eldred <br>
In 1995, </tt>a father was frustrated that his daughters didn't seem to like <br>
Hawthorne. No doubt there was more than one such father, but at least <br>
one did something about it. Eric Eldred, a retired computer program-mer <br>
living in New Hampshire, decided to put Hawthorne on the <br>
Web. An electronic version, Eldred thought, with links to pictures and <br>
explanatory text, would make this nineteenth-century author's work <br>
come alive. <br>
It didn't work&mdash;at least for his daughters. They didn't find Haw-thorne <br>
any more interesting than before. But Eldred's experiment gave <br>
birth to a hobby, and his hobby begat a cause: Eldred would build a <br>
library of public domain works by scanning these works and making <br>
them available for free. <br>
Eldred's library was not simply a copy of certain public domain <br>
works, though even a copy would have been of great value to people <br>
across the world who can't get access to printed versions of these <br>
works. Instead, Eldred was producing derivative works from these <br>
public domain works. Just as Disney turned Grimm into stories more <br>

<br>
</p><p>
accessible to the twentieth century, Eldred transformed Hawthorne, <br>
and many others, into a form more accessible&mdash;technically accessi-ble&mdash;<br>
today. <br>
Eldred's freedom to do this with Hawthorne's work grew from the <br>
same source as Disney's. Hawthorne's <i>Scarlet Letter </i>had passed into the <br>
public domain in 1907. It was free for anyone to take without the per-mission <br>
of the Hawthorne estate or anyone else. Some, such as Dover <br>
Press and Penguin Classics, take works from the public domain and <br>
produce printed editions, which they sell in bookstores across the <br>
country. Others, such as Disney, take these stories and turn them into <br>
animated cartoons, sometimes successfully (Cinderella), sometimes not <br>
(The <i>Hunchback of Notre Dame, Treasure Planet). </i>These are all commer-cial <br>
publications of public domain works. <br>
The Internet created the possibility of noncommercial publications <br>
of public domain works. Eldred's is just one example. There are liter-ally <br>
thousands of others. Hundreds of thousands from across the world <br>
have discovered this platform of expression and now use it to share <br>
works that are, by law, free for the taking. This has produced what we <br>
might call the "noncommercial publishing industry," which before the <br>
Internet was limited to people with large egos or with political or so-cial <br>
causes. But with the Internet, it includes a wide range of individu-als <br>
and groups dedicated to spreading culture generally. 1 <br>
As I said, Eldred lives in New Hampshire. In 1998, Robert Frost's <br>
collection of poems <i>New Hampshire </i>was slated to pass into the public <br>
domain. Eldred wanted to post that collection in his free public library. <br>
But Congress got in the way. As I described in chapter 10, in 1998, for <br>
the eleventh time in forty years, Congress extended the terms of exist-ing <br>
copyrights&mdash;this time by twenty years. Eldred would not be free to <br>
add any works more recent than 1923 to his collection until 2019. In-deed, <br>
no copyrighted work would pass into the public domain until <br>
that year (and not even then, if Congress extends the term again). By <br>
contrast, in the same period, more than 1 million patents will pass into <br>
the public domain. <br>

This was the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act <br>
(CTEA), enacted in memory of the congressman and former musician <br>
Sonny Bono, who, his widow, Mary Bono, says, believed that "copy-rights <br>
should be forever." 2 <br>
Eldred decided to fight this law. He first resolved to fight it through <br>
civil disobedience. In a series of interviews, Eldred announced that he <br>
would publish as planned, CTEA notwithstanding. But because of a <br>
second law passed in 1998, the NET (No Electronic Theft) Act, his act <br>
of publishing would make Eldred a felon&mdash;whether or not anyone <br>
complained. This was a dangerous strategy for a disabled programmer <br>
to undertake. <br>
It was here that I became involved in Eldred's battle. I was a con-stitutional <br>
scholar whose first passion was constitutional interpreta-tion. <br>
And though constitutional law courses never focus upon the <br>
Progress Clause of the Constitution, it had always struck me as impor-tantly <br>
different. As you know, the Constitution says, <br>
</p><p>
Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science . . . <br>
by securing for limited Times to Authors ... exclusive Right to <br>
their ... Writings. . . . <br>
</p><p>
As I've described, this clause is unique within the power-granting <br>
clause of Article I, section 8 of our Constitution. Every other clause <br>
granting power to Congress simply says Congress has the power to do <br>
something&mdash;for example, to regulate "commerce among the several <br>
states" or "declare War." But here, the "something" is something quite spe-cific&mdash;<br>
to "promote ... Progress"&mdash;through means that are also specific&mdash;<br>
by "securing" "exclusive Rights" (i. e., copyrights) "for limited Times." <br>
In the past forty years, Congress has gotten into the practice of ex-tending <br>
existing terms of copyright protection. What puzzled me <br>
about this was, if Congress has the power to extend existing terms, <br>
then the Constitution's requirement that terms be "limited" will have <br>
no practical effect. If every time a copyright is about to expire, Con-BALANCES <br>

gress has the power to extend its term, then Congress can achieve what <br>
the Constitution plainly forbids&mdash;perpetual terms "on the installment <br>
plan," as Professor Peter Jaszi so nicely put it. <br>
As an academic, my first response was to hit the books. I remember <br>
sitting late at the office, scouring on-line databases for any serious con-sideration <br>
of the question. No one had ever challenged Congress's <br>
practice of extending existing terms. That failure may in part be why <br>
Congress seemed so untroubled in its habit. That, and the fact that the <br>
practice had become so lucrative for Congress. Congress knows that <br>
copyright owners will be willing to pay a great deal of money to see <br>
their copyright terms extended. And so Congress is quite happy to <br>
keep this gravy train going. <br>
For this is the core of the corruption in our present system of <br>
government. "Corruption" not in the sense that representatives are bribed. <br>
Rather, "corruption" in the sense that the system induces the benefici-aries <br>
of Congress's acts to raise and give money to Congress to induce <br>
it to act. There's only so much time; there's only so much Congress can <br>
do. Why not limit its actions to those things it must do&mdash;and those <br>
things that pay? Extending copyright terms pays. <br>
If that's not obvious to you, consider the following: Say you're one <br>
of the very few lucky copyright owners whose copyright continues to <br>
make money one hundred years after it was created. The Estate of <br>
Robert Frost is a good example. Frost died in 1963. His poetry contin-ues <br>
to be extraordinarily valuable. Thus the Robert Frost estate bene-fits <br>
greatly from any extension of copyright, since no publisher would <br>
pay the estate any money if the poems Frost wrote could be published <br>
by anyone for free. <br>
So imagine the Robert Frost estate is earning $100,000 a year from <br>
three of Frost's poems. And imagine the copyright for those poems <br>
is about to expire. You sit on the board of the Robert Frost estate. <br>
Your financial adviser comes to your board meeting with a very grim <br>
report: <br>
"Next year," the adviser announces, "our copyrights in works A, B, <br>

<br>

and C will expire. That means that after next year, we will no longer be <br>
receiving the annual royalty check of $100,000 from the publishers of <br>
those works. <br>
"There's a proposal in Congress, however," she continues, "that <br>
could change this. A few congressmen are floating a bill to extend the <br>
terms of copyright by twenty years. That bill would be extraordinarily <br>
valuable to us. So we should hope this bill passes." <br>
"Hope?" a fellow board member says. "Can't we be doing something <br>
about it?" <br>
"Well, obviously, yes," the adviser responds. "We could contribute <br>
to the campaigns of a number of representatives to try to assure that <br>
they support the bill." <br>
You hate politics. You hate contributing to campaigns. So you want <br>
to know whether this disgusting practice is worth it. "How much <br>
would we get if this extension were passed?" you ask the adviser. "How <br>
much is it worth?" <br>
"Well," the adviser says, "if you're confident that you will continue <br>
to get at least $100,000 a year from these copyrights, and you use the <br>
'discount rate' that we use to evaluate estate investments (6 percent), <br>
then this law would be worth $1,146,000 to the estate." <br>
You're a bit shocked by the number, but you quickly come to the <br>
correct conclusion: <br>
"So you're saying it would be worth it for us to pay more than <br>
$1,000,000 in campaign contributions if we were confident those con-tributions <br>
would assure that the bill was passed?" <br>
"Absolutely," the adviser responds. "It is worth it to you to con-tribute <br>
up to the 'present value' of the income you expect from these <br>
copyrights. Which for us means over $1,000,000." <br>
You quickly get the point&mdash;you as the member of the board and, I <br>
trust, you the reader. Each time copyrights are about to expire, every <br>
beneficiary in the position of the Robert Frost estate faces the same <br>
choice: If they can contribute to get a law passed to extend copyrights, <br>
they will benefit greatly from that extension. And so each time copy-BALANCES <br>

rights are about to expire, there is a massive amount of lobbying to get <br>
the copyright term extended. <br>
Thus a congressional perpetual motion machine: So long as legisla-tion <br>
can be bought (albeit indirectly), there will be all the incentive in <br>
the world to buy further extensions of copyright. <br>
In the lobbying that led to the passage of the Sonny Bono Copy-right <br>
Term Extension Act, this "theory" about incentives was proved <br>
real. Ten of the thirteen original sponsors of the act in the House <br>
received the maximum contribution from Disney's political action <br>
committee; in the Senate, eight of the twelve sponsors received contri-butions. 3 <br>
The RIAA and the MPAA are estimated to have spent over <br>
$1.5 million lobbying in the 1998 election cycle. They paid out more <br>
than $200,000 in campaign contributions. 4 Disney is estimated to have <br>
contributed more than $800,000 to reelection campaigns in the 1998 <br>
cycle. 5 <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Constitutional law </tt>is not oblivious to the obvious. Or at least, <br>
it need not be. So when I was considering Eldred's complaint, this re-ality <br>
about the never-ending incentives to increase the copyright term <br>
was central to my thinking. In my view, a pragmatic court committed <br>
to interpreting and applying the Constitution of our framers would see <br>
that if Congress has the power to extend existing terms, then there <br>
would be no effective constitutional requirement that terms be "lim-ited." <br>
If they could extend it once, they would extend it again and again <br>
and again. <br>
It was also my judgment that <i>this </i>Supreme Court would not allow <br>
Congress to extend existing terms. As anyone close to the Supreme <br>
Court's work knows, this Court has increasingly restricted the power <br>
of Congress when it has viewed Congress's actions as exceeding the <br>
power granted to it by the Constitution. Among constitutional schol-ars, <br>
the most famous example of this trend was the Supreme Court's <br>

decision in 1995 to strike down a law that banned the possession of <br>
guns near schools. <br>
Since 1937, the Supreme Court had interpreted Congress's granted <br>
powers very broadly; so, while the Constitution grants Congress the <br>
power to regulate only "commerce among the several states" (aka "in-terstate <br>
commerce"), the Supreme Court had interpreted that power to <br>
include the power to regulate any activity that merely affected inter-state <br>
commerce. <br>
As the economy grew, this standard increasingly meant that there <br>
was no limit to Congress's power to regulate, since just about every ac-tivity, <br>
when considered on a national scale, affects interstate commerce. <br>
A Constitution designed to limit Congress's power was instead inter-preted <br>
to impose no limit. <br>
The Supreme Court, under Chief Justice Rehnquist's command, <br>
changed that in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Lopez. </i>The government had argued <br>
that possessing guns near schools affected interstate commerce. Guns <br>
near schools increase crime, crime lowers property values, and so on. In <br>
the oral argument, the Chief Justice asked the government whether <br>
there was any activity that would not affect interstate commerce under <br>
the reasoning the government advanced. The government said there <br>
was not; if Congress says an activity affects interstate commerce, then <br>
that activity affects interstate commerce. The Supreme Court, the gov-ernment <br>
said, was not in the position to second-guess Congress. <br>
"We pause to consider the implications of the government's argu-ments," <br>
the Chief Justice wrote. 6 If anything Congress says is interstate <br>
commerce must therefore be considered interstate commerce, then <br>
there would be no limit to Congress's power. The decision in <i>Lopez </i>was <br>
reaffirmed five years later in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Morrison. </i>7 <br>
If a principle were at work here, then it should apply to the Progress <br>
Clause as much as the Commerce Clause. 8 And if it is applied to the <br>
Progress Clause, the principle should yield the conclusion that Con-gress <br>
can't extend an existing term. If Congress could extend an exist-BALANCES <br>

ing term, then there would be no "stopping point" to Congress's power <br>
over terms, though the Constitution expressly states that there is such <br>
a limit. Thus, the same principle applied to the power to grant copy-rights <br>
should entail that Congress is not allowed to extend the term of <br>
existing copyrights. <br>
<i>If, </i>that is, the principle announced in <i>Lopez </i>stood for a principle. <br>
Many believed the decision in <i>Lopez </i>stood for politics&mdash;a conservative <br>
Supreme Court, which believed in states' rights, using its power over <br>
Congress to advance its own personal political preferences. But I re-jected <br>
that view of the Supreme Court's decision. Indeed, shortly after <br>
the decision, I wrote an article demonstrating the "fidelity" in such an <br>
interpretation of the Constitution. The idea that the Supreme Court <br>
decides cases based upon its politics struck me as extraordinarily bor-ing. <br>
I was not going to devote my life to teaching constitutional law if <br>
these nine Justices were going to be petty politicians. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Now let's pause </tt>for a moment to make sure we understand what <br>
the argument in <i>Eldred </i>was not about. By insisting on the Constitu-tion's <br>
limits to copyright, obviously Eldred was not endorsing piracy. <br>
Indeed, in an obvious sense, he was fighting a kind of piracy&mdash;piracy of <br>
the public domain. When Robert Frost wrote his work and when Walt <br>
Disney created Mickey Mouse, the maximum copyright term was just <br>
fifty-six years. Because of interim changes, Frost and Disney had al-ready <br>
enjoyed a seventy-five-year monopoly for their work. They had <br>
gotten the benefit of the bargain that the Constitution envisions: In <br>
exchange for a monopoly protected for fifty-six years, they created new <br>
work. But now these entities were using their power&mdash;expressed <br>
through the power of lobbyists' money&mdash;to get another twenty-year <br>
dollop of monopoly. That twenty-year dollop would be taken from the <br>
public domain. Eric Eldred was fighting a piracy that affects us all. <br>
Some people view the public domain with contempt. In their brief <br>

before the Supreme Court, the Nashville Songwriters Association <br>
wrote that the public domain is nothing more than "legal piracy." 9 But <br>
it is not piracy when the law allows it; and in our constitutional system, <br>
our law requires it. Some may not like the Constitution's requirements, <br>
but that doesn't make the Constitution a pirate's charter. <br>
As we've seen, our constitutional system requires limits on copy-right <br>
as a way to assure that copyright holders do not too heavily influ-ence <br>
the development and distribution of our culture. Yet, as Eric <br>
Eldred discovered, we have set up a system that assures that copyright <br>
terms will be repeatedly extended, and extended, and extended. We <br>
have created the perfect storm for the public domain. Copyrights have <br>
not expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to be <br>
bought to extend them again. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>It is valuable </tt>copyrights that are responsible for terms being ex-tended. <br>
Mickey Mouse and "Rhapsody in Blue." These works are too <br>
valuable for copyright owners to ignore. But the real harm to our soci-ety <br>
from copyright extensions is not that Mickey Mouse remains Dis-ney's. <br>
Forget Mickey Mouse. Forget Robert Frost. Forget all the works <br>
from the 1920s and 1930s that have continuing commercial value. The <br>
real harm of term extension comes not from these famous works. The <br>
real harm is to the works that are not famous, not commercially ex-ploited, <br>
and no longer available as a result. <br>
If you look at the work created in the first twenty years (1923 to <br>
1942) affected by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, <br>
2 percent of that work has any continuing commercial value. It was the <br>
copyright holders for that 2 percent who pushed the CTEA through. <br>
But the law and its effect were not limited to that 2 percent. The law <br>
extended the terms of copyright generally. 10 <br>

work. In 1930, 10,047 books were published. In 2000, 174 of those <br>
books were still in print. Let's say you were Brewster Kahle, and you <br>
wanted to make available to the world in your iArchive project the re-maining <br>
9,873. What would you have to do? <br>
Well, first, you'd have to determine which of the 9,873 books were <br>
still under copyright. That requires going to a library (these data are <br>
not on-line) and paging through tomes of books, cross-checking the <br>
titles and authors of the 9,873 books with the copyright registration <br>
and renewal records for works published in 1930. That will produce a <br>
list of books still under copyright. <br>
Then for the books still under copyright, you would need to locate <br>
the current copyright owners. How would you do that? <br>
Most people think that there must be a list of these copyright own-ers <br>
somewhere. Practical people think this way. How could there be <br>
thousands and thousands of government monopolies without there <br>
being at least a list? <br>
But there is no list. There may be a name from 1930, and then in <br>
1959, of the person who registered the copyright. But just think prac-tically <br>
about how impossibly difficult it would be to track down thou-sands <br>
of such records&mdash;especially since the person who registered is <br>
not necessarily the current owner. And we're just talking about 1930! <br>
"But there isn't a list of who owns property generally," the apolo-gists <br>
for the system respond. "Why should there be a list of copyright <br>
owners?" <br>
Well, actually, if you think about it, there <i>are </i>plenty of lists of who <br>
owns what property. Think about deeds on houses, or titles to cars. <br>
And where there isn't a list, the code of real space is pretty good at sug-gesting <br>
who the owner of a bit of property is. (A swing set in your <br>
backyard is probably yours.) So formally or informally, we have a pretty <br>
good way to know who owns what tangible property. <br>
So: You walk down a street and see a house. You can know who <br>
owns the house by looking it up in the courthouse registry. If you see <br>
a car, there is ordinarily a license plate that will link the owner to the <br>

kids, then okay: Here's a bit of property whose owner we can't easily <br>
determine. It is the exception that proves the rule: that we ordinarily <br>
know quite well who owns what property. <br>
Compare this story to intangible property. You go into a library. <br>
The library owns the books. But who owns the copyrights? As I've al-ready <br>
described, there's no list of copyright owners. There are authors' <br>
names, of course, but their copyrights could have been assigned, or <br>
passed down in an estate like Grandma's old jewelry. To know who <br>
owns what, you would have to hire a private detective. The bottom <br>
line: The owner cannot easily be located. And in a regime like ours, in <br>
which it is a felony to use such property without the property owner's <br>
permission, the property isn't going to be used. <br>
The consequence with respect to old books is that they won't be <br>
digitized, and hence will simply rot away on shelves. But the conse-quence <br>
for other creative works is much more dire. <br>
Consider the story of Michael Agee, chairman of Hal Roach Stu-dios, <br>
which owns the copyrights for the Laurel and Hardy films. Agee <br>
is a direct beneficiary of the Bono Act. The Laurel and Hardy films <br>
were made between 1921 and 1951. Only one of these films, <i>The Lucky <br>
Dog, </i>is currently out of copyright. But for the CTEA, films made after <br>
1923 would have begun entering the public domain. Because Agee <br>
controls the exclusive rights for these popular films, he makes a great <br>
deal of money. According to one estimate, "Roach has sold about <br>
60,000 videocassettes and 50,000 DVDs of the duo's silent films." 11 <br>
Yet Agee opposed the CTEA. His reasons demonstrate a rare <br>
virtue in this culture: selflessness. He argued in a brief before the <br>
Supreme Court that the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act <br>
will, if left standing, destroy a whole generation of American film. <br>
His argument is straightforward. A tiny fraction of this work has <br>

any continuing commercial value. The rest&mdash;to the extent it survives at <br>
all&mdash;sits in vaults gathering dust. It may be that some of this work not <br>
now commercially valuable will be deemed to be valuable by the own-ers <br>
of the vaults. For this to occur, however, the commercial benefit <br>
from the work must exceed the costs of making the work available for <br>
distribution. <br>
We can't know the benefits, but we do know a lot about the costs. <br>
For most of the history of film, the costs of restoring film were very <br>
high; digital technology has lowered these costs substantially. While <br>
it cost more than $10,000 to restore a ninety-minute black-and-white <br>
film in 1993, it can now cost as little as $100 to digitize one hour of 8 <br>
mm film. 12 <br>
Restoration technology is not the only cost, nor the most impor-tant. <br>
Lawyers, too, are a cost, and increasingly, a very important one. In <br>
addition to preserving the film, a distributor needs to secure the rights. <br>
And to secure the rights for a film that is under copyright, you need to <br>
locate the copyright owner. <br>
Or more accurately, <i>owners. </i>As we've seen, there isn't only a single <br>
copyright associated with a film; there are many. There isn't a single <br>
person whom you can contact about those copyrights; there are as <br>
many as can hold the rights, which turns out to be an extremely large <br>
number. Thus the costs of clearing the rights to these films is excep-tionally <br>
high. <br>
"But can't you just restore the film, distribute it, and then pay the <br>
copyright owner when she shows up?" Sure, if you want to commit a <br>
felony. And even if you're not worried about committing a felony, when <br>
she does show up, she'll have the right to sue you for all the profits you <br>
have made. So, if you're successful, you can be fairly confident you'll be <br>
getting a call from someone's lawyer. And if you're not successful, you <br>
won't make enough to cover the costs of your own lawyer. Either way, <br>
you have to talk to a lawyer. And as is too often the case, saying you have <br>
to talk to a lawyer is the same as saying you won't make any money. <br>
For some films, the benefit of releasing the film may well exceed <br>

<br>

these costs. But for the vast majority of them, there is no way the ben-efit <br>
would outweigh the legal costs. Thus, for the vast majority of old <br>
films, Agee argued, the film will not be restored and distributed until <br>
the copyright expires. <br>
But by the time the copyright for these films expires, the film will <br>
have expired. These films were produced on nitrate-based stock, and <br>
nitrate stock dissolves over time. They will be gone, and the metal can-isters <br>
in which they are now stored will be filled with nothing more <br>
than dust. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Of all the </tt>creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny <br>
fraction has continuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the <br>
copyright is a crucially important legal device. For that tiny fraction, <br>
the copyright creates incentives to produce and distribute the cre-ative <br>
work. For that tiny fraction, the copyright acts as an "engine of <br>
free expression." <br>
But even for that tiny fraction, the actual time during which the <br>
creative work has a commercial life is extremely short. As I've indi-cated, <br>
most books go out of print within one year. The same is true of <br>
music and film. Commercial culture is sharklike. It must keep moving. <br>
And when a creative work falls out of favor with the commercial dis-tributors, <br>
the commercial life ends. <br>
Yet that doesn't mean the life of the creative work ends. We don't <br>
keep libraries of books in order to compete with Barnes &amp; Noble, and <br>
we don't have archives of films because we expect people to choose be-tween <br>
spending Friday night watching new movies and spending Fri-day <br>
night watching a 1930 news documentary. The noncommercial life <br>
of culture is important and valuable&mdash;for entertainment but also, and <br>
more importantly, for knowledge. To understand who we are, and <br>
where we came from, and how we have made the mistakes that we <br>
have, we need to have access to this history. <br>
Copyrights in this context do not drive an engine of free expression. <br>

<br>
</p><p>
In this context, there is no need for an exclusive right. Copyrights in <br>
this context do no good. <br>
Yet, for most of our history, they also did little harm. For most of <br>
our history, when a work ended its commercial life, there was no <br>
<i>copyright-related use </i>that would be inhibited by an exclusive right. <br>
When a book went out of print, you could not buy it from a publisher. <br>
But you could still buy it from a used book store, and when a used book <br>
store sells it, in America, at least, there is no need to pay the copyright <br>
owner anything. Thus, the ordinary use of a book after its commercial <br>
life ended was a use that was independent of copyright law. <br>
The same was effectively true of film. Because the costs of restoring <br>
a film&mdash;the real economic costs, not the lawyer costs&mdash;were so high, it <br>
was never at all feasible to preserve or restore film. Like the remains of <br>
a great dinner, when it's over, it's over. Once a film passed out of its <br>
commercial life, it may have been archived for a bit, but that was the <br>
end of its life so long as the market didn't have more to offer. <br>
In other words, though copyright has been relatively short for most <br>
of our history, long copyrights wouldn't have mattered for the works <br>
that lost their commercial value. Long copyrights for these works <br>
would not have interfered with anything. <br>
But this situation has now changed. <br>
One crucially important consequence of the emergence of digital <br>
technologies is to enable the archive that Brewster Kahle dreams of. <br>
Digital technologies now make it possible to preserve and give access <br>
to all sorts of knowledge. Once a book goes out of print, we can now <br>
imagine digitizing it and making it available to everyone, forever. Once <br>
a film goes out of distribution, we could digitize it and make it avail-able <br>
to everyone, forever. Digital technologies give new life to copy-righted <br>
material after it passes out of its commercial life. It is now <br>
possible to preserve and assure universal access to this knowledge and <br>
culture, whereas before it was not. <br>
And now copyright law does get in the way. Every step of produc-226 <br>

ing this digital archive of our culture infringes on the exclusive right of <br>
copyright. To digitize a book is to copy it. To do that requires permis-sion <br>
of the copyright owner. The same with music, film, or any other <br>
aspect of our culture protected by copyright. The effort to make these <br>
things available to history, or to researchers, or to those who just want <br>
to explore, is now inhibited by a set of rules that were written for a rad-ically <br>
different context. <br>
Here is the core of the harm that comes from extending terms: <br>
Now that technology enables us to rebuild the library of Alexandria, <br>
the law gets in the way. And it doesn't get in the way for any useful <br>
<i>copyright </i>purpose, for the purpose of copyright is to enable the com-mercial <br>
market that spreads culture. No, we are talking about culture <br>
after it has lived its commercial life. In this context, copyright is serv-ing <br>
no purpose <i>at all </i>related to the spread of knowledge. In this con-text, <br>
copyright is not an engine of free expression. Copyright is a brake. <br>
You may well ask, "But if digital technologies lower the costs for <br>
Brewster Kahle, then they will lower the costs for Random House, too. <br>
So won't Random House do as well as Brewster Kahle in spreading <br>
culture widely?" <br>
Maybe. Someday. But there is absolutely no evidence to suggest <br>
that publishers would be as complete as libraries. If Barnes &amp; Noble <br>
offered to lend books from its stores for a low price, would that elimi-nate <br>
the need for libraries? Only if you think that the only role of a li-brary <br>
is to serve what "the market" would demand. But if you think the <br>
role of a library is bigger than this&mdash;if you think its role is to archive <br>
culture, whether there's a demand for any particular bit of that culture <br>
or not&mdash;then we can't count on the commercial market to do our li-brary <br>
work for us. <br>
I would be the first to agree that it should do as much as it can: We <br>
should rely upon the market as much as possible to spread and enable <br>
culture. My message is absolutely not antimarket. But where we see the <br>
market is not doing the job, then we should allow nonmarket forces the <br>

freedom to fill the gaps. As one researcher calculated for American cul-ture, <br>
94 percent of the films, books, and music produced between 1923 <br>
and 1946 is not commercially available. However much you love the <br>

<tt>In January 1999, </tt>we filed a lawsuit on Eric Eldred's behalf in fed-eral <br>
district court in Washington, D. C., asking the court to declare the <br>
Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act unconstitutional. The two <br>
central claims that we made were (1) that extending existing terms vio-lated <br>
the Constitution's "limited Times" requirement, and (2) that ex-tending <br>
terms by another twenty years violated the First Amendment. <br>
The district court dismissed our claims without even hearing an ar-gument. <br>
A panel of the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit also dis-missed <br>
our claims, though after hearing an extensive argument. But <br>
that decision at least had a dissent, by one of the most conservative <br>
judges on that court. That dissent gave our claims life. <br>
Judge David Sentelle said the CTEA violated the requirement that <br>
copyrights be for "limited Times" only. His argument was as elegant as <br>
it was simple: If Congress can extend existing terms, then there is no <br>
"stopping point" to Congress's power under the Copyright Clause. The <br>
power to extend existing terms means Congress is not required to grant <br>
terms that are "limited." Thus, Judge Sentelle argued, the court had to <br>
interpret the term "limited Times" to give it meaning. And the best in-terpretation, <br>
Judge Sentelle argued, would be to deny Congress the <br>
power to extend existing terms. <br>
We asked the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit as a whole to <br>
hear the case. Cases are ordinarily heard in panels of three, except for <br>
important cases or cases that raise issues specific to the circuit as a <br>
whole, where the court will sit "en banc" to hear the case. <br>
The Court of Appeals rejected our request to hear the case en banc. <br>

D. C. Circuit, Judge David Tatel. Both the most conservative and the <br>
most liberal judges in the D. C. Circuit believed Congress had over-stepped <br>
its bounds. <br>
It was here that most expected <i>Eldred </i>v. <i>Ashcroft </i>would die, for the <br>
Supreme Court rarely reviews any decision by a court of appeals. (It <br>
hears about one hundred cases a year, out of more than five thousand <br>
appeals.) And it practically never reviews a decision that upholds a <br>
statute when no other court has yet reviewed the statute. <br>
But in February 2002, the Supreme Court surprised the world by <br>
granting our petition to review the D. C. Circuit opinion. Argument <br>
was set for October of 2002. The summer would be spent writing <br>
briefs and preparing for argument. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>It is over </tt>a year later as I write these words. It is still astonishingly <br>
hard. If you know anything at all about this story, you know that we <br>
lost the appeal. And if you know something more than just the mini-mum, <br>
you probably think there was no way this case could have been <br>
won. After our defeat, I received literally thousands of missives by <br>
well-wishers and supporters, thanking me for my work on behalf of <br>
this noble but doomed cause. And none from this pile was more sig-nificant <br>
to me than the e-mail from my client, Eric Eldred. <br>
But my client and these friends were wrong. This case could have <br>
been won. It should have been won. And no matter how hard I try to <br>
retell this story to myself, I can never escape believing that my own <br>
mistake lost it. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>The mistake </tt>was made early, though it became obvious only at the <br>
very end. Our case had been supported from the very beginning by an ex-traordinary <br>
lawyer, Geoffrey Stewart, and by the law firm he had moved <br>
to, Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue. Jones Day took a great deal of heat <br>
from its copyright-protectionist clients for supporting us. They ig-BALANCES <br>

<br>
</p><p>
nored this pressure (something that few law firms today would ever <br>
do), and throughout the case, they gave it everything they could. <br>
There were three key lawyers on the case from Jones Day. Geoff <br>
Stewart was the first, but then Dan Bromberg and Don Ayer became <br>
quite involved. Bromberg and Ayer in particular had a common view <br>
about how this case would be won: We would only win, they repeatedly <br>
told me, if we could make the issue seem "important" to the Supreme <br>
Court. It had to seem as if dramatic harm were being done to free <br>
speech and free culture; otherwise, they would never vote against "the <br>
most powerful media companies in the world." <br>
I hate this view of the law. Of course I thought the Sonny Bono Act <br>
was a dramatic harm to free speech and free culture. Of course I still <br>
think it is. But the idea that the Supreme Court decides the law based <br>
on how important they believe the issues are is just wrong. It might be <br>
"right" as in "true," I thought, but it is "wrong" as in "it just shouldn't be <br>
that way." As I believed that any faithful interpretation of what the <br>
framers of our Constitution did would yield the conclusion that the <br>
CTEA was unconstitutional, and as I believed that any faithful in-terpretation <br>
of what the First Amendment means would yield the <br>
conclusion that the power to extend existing copyright terms is uncon-stitutional, <br>
I was not persuaded that we had to sell our case like soap. <br>
Just as a law that bans the swastika is unconstitutional not because the <br>
Court likes Nazis but because such a law would violate the Constitu-tion, <br>
so too, in my view, would the Court decide whether Congress's <br>
law was constitutional based on the Constitution, not based on whether <br>
they liked the values that the framers put in the Constitution. <br>
In any case, I thought, the Court must already see the danger and <br>
the harm caused by this sort of law. Why else would they grant review? <br>
There was no reason to hear the case in the Supreme Court if they <br>
weren't convinced that this regulation was harmful. So in my view, we <br>
didn't need to persuade them that this law was bad, we needed to show <br>
why it was unconstitutional. <br>
There was one way, however, in which I felt politics would matter <br>

and in which I thought a response was appropriate. I was convinced <br>
that the Court would not hear our arguments if it thought these were <br>
just the arguments of a group of lefty loons. This Supreme Court was <br>
not about to launch into a new field of judicial review if it seemed that <br>
this field of review was simply the preference of a small political minor-ity. <br>
Although my focus in the case was not to demonstrate how bad the <br>
Sonny Bono Act was but to demonstrate that it was unconstitutional, <br>
my hope was to make this argument against a background of briefs that <br>
covered the full range of political views. To show that this claim against <br>
the CTEA was grounded in <i>law </i>and not politics, then, we tried to <br>
gather the widest range of credible critics&mdash;credible not because they <br>
were rich and famous, but because they, in the aggregate, demonstrated <br>
that this law was unconstitutional regardless of one's politics. <br>
The first step happened all by itself. Phyllis Schlafly's organization, <br>
Eagle Forum, had been an opponent of the CTEA from the very be-ginning. <br>
Mrs. Schlafly viewed the CTEA as a sellout by Congress. In <br>
November 1998, she wrote a stinging editorial attacking the Repub-lican <br>
Congress for allowing the law to pass. As she wrote, "Do you <br>
sometimes wonder why bills that create a financial windfall to narrow <br>
special interests slide easily through the intricate legislative process, <br>
while bills that benefit the general public seem to get bogged down?" <br>
The answer, as the editorial documented, was the power of money. <br>
Schlafly enumerated Disney's contributions to the key players on the <br>
committees. It was money, not justice, that gave Mickey Mouse twenty <br>
more years in Disney's control, Schlafly argued. <br>
In the Court of Appeals, Eagle Forum was eager to file a brief sup-porting <br>
our position. Their brief made the argument that became the <br>
core claim in the Supreme Court: If Congress can extend the term of <br>
existing copyrights, there is no limit to Congress's power to set terms. <br>
That strong conservative argument persuaded a strong conservative <br>
judge, Judge Sentelle. <br>
In the Supreme Court, the briefs on our side were about as diverse <br>
as it gets. They included an extraordinary historical brief by the Free <br>

Software Foundation (home of the GNU project that made GNU/ <br>
Linux possible). They included a powerful brief about the costs of un-certainty <br>
by Intel. There were two law professors' briefs, one by copy-right <br>
scholars and one by First Amendment scholars. There was an <br>
exhaustive and uncontroverted brief by the world's experts in the his-tory <br>
of the Progress Clause. And of course, there was a new brief by <br>
Eagle Forum, repeating and strengthening its arguments. <br>
Those briefs framed a legal argument. Then to support the legal <br>
argument, there were a number of powerful briefs by libraries and <br>
archives, including the Internet Archive, the American Association of <br>
Law Libraries, and the National Writers Union. <br>
But two briefs captured the policy argument best. One made the ar-gument <br>
I've already described: A brief by Hal Roach Studios argued that <br>
unless the law was struck, a whole generation of American film would <br>
disappear. The other made the economic argument absolutely clear. <br>
This economists' brief was signed by seventeen economists, including <br>
five Nobel Prize winners, including Ronald Coase, James Buchanan, <br>
Milton Friedman, Kenneth Arrow, and George Akerlof. The econo-mists, <br>
as the list of Nobel winners demonstrates, spanned the political <br>
spectrum. Their conclusions were powerful: There was no plausible <br>
claim that extending the terms of existing copyrights would do anything <br>
to increase incentives to create. Such extensions were nothing more <br>
than "rent-seeking"&mdash;the fancy term economists use to describe <br>
special-interest legislation gone wild. <br>
The same effort at balance was reflected in the legal team we gath-ered <br>
to write our briefs in the case. The Jones Day lawyers had been <br>
with us from the start. But when the case got to the Supreme Court, <br>
we added three lawyers to help us frame this argument to this Court: <br>
Alan Morrison, a lawyer from Public Citizen, a Washington group <br>
that had made constitutional history with a series of seminal victories <br>
in the Supreme Court defending individual rights; my colleague and <br>
dean, Kathleen Sullivan, who had argued many cases in the Court, and <br>

who had advised us early on about a First Amendment strategy; and fi-nally, <br>
former solicitor general Charles Fried. <br>
Fried was a special victory for our side. Every other former solicitor <br>
general was hired by the other side to defend Congress's power to give <br>
media companies the special favor of extended copyright terms. Fried <br>
was the only one who turned down that lucrative assignment to stand <br>
up for something he believed in. He had been Ronald Reagan's chief <br>
lawyer in the Supreme Court. He had helped craft the line of cases that <br>
limited Congress's power in the context of the Commerce Clause. And <br>
while he had argued many positions in the Supreme Court that I per-sonally <br>
disagreed with, his joining the cause was a vote of confidence in <br>
our argument. <br>
The government, in defending the statute, had its collection of <br>
friends, as well. Significantly, however, none of these "friends" included <br>
historians or economists. The briefs on the other side of the case were <br>
written exclusively by major media companies, congressmen, and <br>
copyright holders. <br>
The media companies were not surprising. They had the most to <br>
gain from the law. The congressmen were not surprising either&mdash;they <br>
were defending their power and, indirectly, the gravy train of contribu-tions <br>
such power induced. And of course it was not surprising that the <br>
copyright holders would defend the idea that they should continue to <br>
have the right to control who did what with content they wanted to <br>
control. <br>
Dr. Seuss's representatives, for example, argued that it was better for <br>
the Dr. Seuss estate to control what happened to Dr. Seuss's work&mdash;<br>
better than allowing it to fall into the public domain&mdash;because if this <br>
creativity were in the public domain, then people could use it to "glo-rify <br>
drugs or to create pornography." 14 That was also the motive of <br>
the Gershwin estate, which defended its "protection" of the work of <br>
George Gershwin. They refuse, for example, to license <i>Porgy and Bess <br>
</i>to anyone who refuses to use African Americans in the cast. 15 That's <br>

their view of how this part of American culture should be controlled, <br>
and they wanted this law to help them effect that control. <br>
This argument made clear a theme that is rarely noticed in this de-bate. <br>
When Congress decides to extend the term of existing copy-rights, <br>
Congress is making a choice about which speakers it will favor. <br>
Famous and beloved copyright owners, such as the Gershwin estate <br>
and Dr. Seuss, come to Congress and say, "Give us twenty years to con-trol <br>
the speech about these icons of American culture. We'll do better <br>
with them than anyone else." Congress of course likes to reward the <br>
popular and famous by giving them what they want. But when Con-gress <br>
gives people an exclusive right to speak in a certain way, that's just <br>
what the First Amendment is traditionally meant to block. <br>
We argued as much in a final brief. Not only would upholding the <br>
CTEA mean that there was no limit to the power of Congress to extend <br>
copyrights&mdash;extensions that would further concentrate the market; it <br>
would also mean that there was no limit to Congress's power to play fa-vorites, <br>
through copyright, with who has the right to speak. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Between February </tt>and October, there was little I did beyond <br>
preparing for this case. Early on, as I said, I set the strategy. <br>
The Supreme Court was divided into two important camps. One <br>
camp we called "the Conservatives." The other we called "the Rest." <br>
The Conservatives included Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor, <br>
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas. These five had <br>
been the most consistent in limiting Congress's power. They were the <br>
five who had supported the <i>Lopez/ Morrison </i>line of cases that said that <br>
an enumerated power had to be interpreted to assure that Congress's <br>
powers had limits. <br>
The Rest were the four Justices who had strongly opposed limits on <br>
Congress's power. These four&mdash;Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice <br>
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer&mdash;had repeatedly argued that the Consti-tution <br>
gives Congress broad discretion to decide how best to imple-234 <br>

ment its powers. In case after case, these justices had argued that the <br>
Court's role should be one of deference. Though the votes of these four <br>
justices were the votes that I personally had most consistently agreed <br>
with, they were also the votes that we were least likely to get. <br>
In particular, the least likely was Justice Ginsburg's. In addition to <br>
her general view about deference to Congress (except where issues of <br>
gender are involved), she had been particularly deferential in the con-text <br>
of intellectual property protections. She and her daughter (an ex-cellent <br>
and well-known intellectual property scholar) were cut from <br>
the same intellectual property cloth. We expected she would agree with <br>
the writings of her daughter: that Congress had the power in this con-text <br>
to do as it wished, even if what Congress wished made little sense. <br>
Close behind Justice Ginsburg were two justices whom we also <br>
viewed as unlikely allies, though possible surprises. Justice Souter <br>
strongly favored deference to Congress, as did Justice Breyer. But both <br>
were also very sensitive to free speech concerns. And as we strongly be-lieved, <br>
there was a very important free speech argument against these <br>
retrospective extensions. <br>
The only vote we could be confident about was that of Justice <br>
Stevens. History will record Justice Stevens as one of the greatest <br>
judges on this Court. His votes are consistently eclectic, which just <br>
means that no simple ideology explains where he will stand. But he <br>
had consistently argued for limits in the context of intellectual property <br>
generally. We were fairly confident he would recognize limits here. <br>
This analysis of "the Rest" showed most clearly where our focus <br>
had to be: on the Conservatives. To win this case, we had to crack open <br>
these five and get at least a majority to go our way. Thus, the single over-riding <br>
argument that animated our claim rested on the Conservatives' <br>
most important jurisprudential innovation&mdash;the argument that Judge <br>
Sentelle had relied upon in the Court of Appeals, that Congress's power <br>
must be interpreted so that its enumerated powers have limits. <br>
This then was the core of our strategy&mdash;a strategy for which I am <br>
responsible. We would get the Court to see that just as with the <i>Lopez <br>

</p><p>
case, under the government's argument here, Congress would always <br>
have unlimited power to extend existing terms. If anything was plain <br>
about Congress's power under the Progress Clause, it was that this <br>
power was supposed to be "limited." Our aim would be to get the <br>
Court to reconcile <i>Eldred </i>with <i>Lopez: </i>If Congress's power to regulate <br>
commerce was limited, then so, too, must Congress's power to regulate <br>
copyright be limited. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>The argument </tt>on the government's side came down to this: Con-gress <br>
has done it before. It should be allowed to do it again. The gov-ernment <br>
claimed that from the very beginning, Congress has been <br>
extending the term of existing copyrights. So, the government argued, <br>
the Court should not now say that practice is unconstitutional. <br>
There was some truth to the government's claim, but not much. We <br>
certainly agreed that Congress had extended existing terms in 1831 <br>
and in 1909. And of course, in 1962, Congress began extending exist-ing <br>
terms regularly&mdash;eleven times in forty years. <br>
But this "consistency" should be kept in perspective. Congress ex-tended <br>
existing terms once in the first hundred years of the Republic. <br>
It then extended existing terms once again in the next fifty. Those rare <br>
extensions are in contrast to the now regular practice of extending ex-isting <br>
terms. Whatever restraint Congress had had in the past, that re-straint <br>
was now gone. Congress was now in a cycle of extensions; there <br>
was no reason to expect that cycle would end. This Court had not hes-itated <br>
to intervene where Congress was in a similar cycle of extension. <br>
There was no reason it couldn't intervene here. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Oral argument </tt>was scheduled for the first week in October. I ar-rived <br>
in D. C. two weeks before the argument. During those two <br>
weeks, I was repeatedly "mooted" by lawyers who had volunteered to <br>

<br>

help in the case. Such "moots" are basically practice rounds, where <br>
wannabe justices fire questions at wannabe winners. <br>
I was convinced that to win, I had to keep the Court focused on a <br>
single point: that if this extension is permitted, then there is no limit to <br>
the power to set terms. Going with the government would mean that <br>
terms would be effectively unlimited; going with us would give Con-gress <br>
a clear line to follow: Don't extend existing terms. The moots <br>
were an effective practice; I found ways to take every question back to <br>
this central idea. <br>
One moot was before the lawyers at Jones Day. Don Ayer was the <br>
skeptic. He had served in the Reagan Justice Department with So-licitor <br>
General Charles Fried. He had argued many cases before the <br>
Supreme Court. And in his review of the moot, he let his concern <br>
speak: <br>
"I'm just afraid that unless they really see the harm, they won't be <br>
willing to upset this practice that the government says has been a con-sistent <br>
practice for two hundred years. You have to make them see the <br>
harm&mdash;passionately get them to see the harm. For if they don't see <br>
that, then we haven't any chance of winning." <br>
He may have argued many cases before this Court, I thought, but <br>
he didn't understand its soul. As a clerk, I had seen the Justices do the <br>
right thing&mdash;not because of politics but because it was right. As a law <br>
professor, I had spent my life teaching my students that this Court <br>
does the right thing&mdash;not because of politics but because it is right. As <br>
I listened to Ayer's plea for passion in pressing politics, I understood <br>
his point, and I rejected it. Our argument was right. That was enough. <br>
Let the politicians learn to see that it was also good. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>The night before </tt>the argument, a line of people began to form <br>
in front of the Supreme Court. The case had become a focus of the <br>
press and of the movement to free culture. Hundreds stood in line <br>

<br>
</p><p>
for the chance to see the proceedings. Scores spent the night on the <br>
Supreme Court steps so that they would be assured a seat. <br>
Not everyone has to wait in line. People who know the Justices can <br>
ask for seats they control. (I asked Justice Scalia's chambers for seats for <br>
my parents, for example.) Members of the Supreme Court bar can get <br>
a seat in a special section reserved for them. And senators and con-gressmen <br>
have a special place where they get to sit, too. And finally, of <br>
course, the press has a gallery, as do clerks working for the Justices on <br>
the Court. As we entered that morning, there was no place that was <br>
not taken. This was an argument about intellectual property law, yet <br>
the halls were filled. As I walked in to take my seat at the front of the <br>
Court, I saw my parents sitting on the left. As I sat down at the table, <br>
I saw Jack Valenti sitting in the special section ordinarily reserved for <br>
family of the Justices. <br>
When the Chief Justice called me to begin my argument, I began <br>
where I intended to stay: on the question of the limits on Congress's <br>
power. This was a case about enumerated powers, I said, and whether <br>
those enumerated powers had any limit. <br>
Justice O'Connor stopped me within one minute of my opening. <br>
The history was bothering her. <br>
</p><p>
justice o'connor: Congress has extended the term so often <br>
through the years, and if you are right, don't we run the risk of <br>
upsetting previous extensions of time? I mean, this seems to be a <br>
practice that began with the very first act. <br>
</p><p>
She was quite willing to concede "that this flies directly in the face <br>
of what the framers had in mind." But my response again and again <br>
was to emphasize limits on Congress's power. <br>
</p><p>
mr. lessig: Well, if it flies in the face of what the framers had in <br>
mind, then the question is, is there a way of interpreting their <br>

<br>

words that gives effect to what they had in mind, and the answer <br>
is yes. <br>
</p><p>
There were two points in this argument when I should have seen <br>
where the Court was going. The first was a question by Justice <br>
Kennedy, who observed, <br>
</p><p>
justice kennedy: Well, I suppose implicit in the argument that <br>
the '76 act, too, should have been declared void, and that we <br>
might leave it alone because of the disruption, is that for all these <br>
years the act has impeded progress in science and the useful arts. <br>
I just don't see any empirical evidence for that. <br>
</p><p>
Here follows my clear mistake. Like a professor correcting a stu-dent, <br>
I answered, <br>
</p><p>
mr. lessig: Justice, we are not making an empirical claim at all. <br>
Nothing in our Copyright Clause claim hangs upon the empirical <br>
assertion about impeding progress. Our only argument is this is a <br>
structural limit necessary to assure that what would be an effec-tively <br>
perpetual term not be permitted under the copyright laws. <br>
</p><p>
That was a correct answer, but it wasn't the right answer. The right <br>
answer was instead that there was an obvious and profound harm. Any <br>
number of briefs had been written about it. He wanted to hear it. And <br>
here was the place Don Ayer's advice should have mattered. This was a <br>
softball; my answer was a swing and a miss. <br>
The second came from the Chief, for whom the whole case had <br>
been crafted. For the Chief Justice had crafted the <i>Lopez </i>ruling, and we <br>
hoped that he would see this case as its second cousin. <br>
It was clear a second into his question that he wasn't at all sympa-thetic. <br>
To him, we were a bunch of anarchists. As he asked: <br>

<br>
</p><p>
chief justice: Well, but you want more than that. You want the <br>
right to copy verbatim other people's books, don't you? <br>
</p><p>
mr. lessig: We want the right to copy verbatim works that <br>
should be in the public domain and would be in the public do-main <br>
but for a statute that cannot be justified under ordinary First <br>
Amendment analysis or under a proper reading of the limits built <br>
into the Copyright Clause. <br>
</p><p>
Things went better for us when the government gave its argument; <br>
for now the Court picked up on the core of our claim. As Justice Scalia <br>
asked Solicitor General Olson, <br>
</p><p>
justice scalia: You say that the functional equivalent of an un-limited <br>
time would be a violation [of the Constitution], but that's <br>
precisely the argument that's being made by petitioners here, that <br>
a limited time which is extendable is the functional equivalent of <br>
an unlimited time. <br>
</p><p>
When Olson was finished, it was my turn to give a closing rebuttal. <br>
Olson's flailing had revived my anger. But my anger still was directed <br>
to the academic, not the practical. The government was arguing as if <br>
this were the first case ever to consider limits on Congress's Copyright <br>
and Patent Clause power. Ever the professor and not the advocate, I <br>
closed by pointing out the long history of the Court imposing limits on <br>
Congress's power in the name of the Copyright and Patent Clause&mdash;<br>
indeed, the very first case striking a law of Congress as exceeding a spe-cific <br>
enumerated power was based upon the Copyright and Patent <br>
Clause. All true. But it wasn't going to move the Court to my side. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>As I left </tt>the court that day, I knew there were a hundred points I <br>

answered differently. But one way of thinking about this case left me <br>
optimistic. <br>
The government had been asked over and over again, what is the <br>
limit? Over and over again, it had answered there is no limit. This <br>
was precisely the answer I wanted the Court to hear. For I could not <br>
imagine how the Court could understand that the government be-lieved <br>
Congress's power was unlimited under the terms of the Copy-right <br>
Clause, and sustain the government's argument. The solicitor <br>
general had made my argument for me. No matter how often I tried, <br>
I could not understand how the Court could find that Congress's <br>
power under the Commerce Clause was limited, but under the Copy-right <br>
Clause, unlimited. In those rare moments when I let myself be-lieve <br>
that we may have prevailed, it was because I felt this Court&mdash;in <br>
particular, the Conservatives&mdash;would feel itself constrained by the rule <br>
of law that it had established elsewhere. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>The morning </tt>of January 15, 2003, I was five minutes late to the office <br>
and missed the 7: 00 A. M. call from the Supreme Court clerk. Listening to <br>
the message, I could tell in an instant that she had bad news to report. The <br>
Supreme Court had affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. Seven <br>
justices had voted in the majority. There were two dissents. <br>
A few seconds later, the opinions arrived by e-mail. I took the <br>
phone off the hook, posted an announcement to our blog, and sat <br>
down to see where I had been wrong in my reasoning. <br>
My <i>reasoning. </i>Here was a case that pitted all the money in the <br>
world against <i>reasoning. </i>And here was the last naïve law professor, <br>
scouring the pages, looking for reasoning. <br>
I first scoured the opinion, looking for how the Court would dis-tinguish <br>
the principle in this case from the principle in <i>Lopez. </i>The ar-gument <br>
was nowhere to be found. The case was not even cited. The <br>
argument that was the core argument of our case did not even appear <br>
in the Court's opinion. <br>

Justice Ginsburg simply ignored the enumerated powers argument. <br>
Consistent with her view that Congress's power was not limited gener-ally, <br>
she had found Congress's power not limited here. <br>
Her opinion was perfectly reasonable&mdash;for her, and for Justice <br>
Souter. Neither believes in <i>Lopez. </i>It would be too much to expect them <br>
to write an opinion that recognized, much less explained, the doctrine <br>
they had worked so hard to defeat. <br>
But as I realized what had happened, I couldn't quite believe what I <br>
was reading. I had said there was no way this Court could reconcile <br>
limited powers with the Commerce Clause and unlimited powers with <br>
the Progress Clause. It had never even occurred to me that they could <br>
reconcile the two simply <i>by not addressing the argument. </i>There was no <br>
inconsistency because they would not talk about the two together. <br>
There was therefore no principle that followed from the <i>Lopez </i>case: In <br>
that context, Congress's power would be limited, but in this context it <br>
would not. <br>
Yet by what right did they get to choose which of the framers' val-ues <br>
they would respect? By what right did they&mdash;the silent five&mdash;get to <br>
select the part of the Constitution they would enforce based on the val-ues <br>
they thought important? We were right back to the argument that <br>
I said I hated at the start: I had failed to convince them that the issue <br>
here was important, and I had failed to recognize that however much I <br>
might hate a system in which the Court gets to pick the constitutional <br>
values that it will respect, that is the system we have. <br>
Justices Breyer and Stevens wrote very strong dissents. Stevens's <br>
opinion was crafted internal to the law: He argued that the tradition of <br>
intellectual property law should not support this unjustified extension <br>
of terms. He based his argument on a parallel analysis that had gov-erned <br>
in the context of patents (so had we). But the rest of the Court <br>
discounted the parallel&mdash;without explaining how the very same words <br>
in the Progress Clause could come to mean totally different things de-pending <br>
upon whether the words were about patents or copyrights. <br>
The Court let Justice Stevens's charge go unanswered. <br>

Justice Breyer's opinion, perhaps the best opinion he has ever writ-ten, <br>
was external to the Constitution. He argued that the term of copy-rights <br>
has become so long as to be effectively unlimited. We had said <br>
that under the current term, a copyright gave an author 99.8 percent of <br>
the value of a perpetual term. Breyer said we were wrong, that the ac-tual <br>
number was 99.9997 percent of a perpetual term. Either way, the <br>
point was clear: If the Constitution said a term had to be "limited," and <br>
the existing term was so long as to be effectively unlimited, then it was <br>
unconstitutional. <br>
These two justices understood all the arguments we had made. But <br>
because neither believed in the <i>Lopez </i>case, neither was willing to push <br>
it as a reason to reject this extension. The case was decided without <br>
anyone having addressed the argument that we had carried from Judge <br>
Sentelle. It was <i>Hamlet </i>without the Prince. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Defeat brings depression. </tt>They say it is a sign of health when <br>
depression gives way to anger. My anger came quickly, but it didn't cure <br>
the depression. This anger was of two sorts. <br>
It was first anger with the five "Conservatives." It would have been <br>
one thing for them to have explained why the principle of <i>Lopez </i>didn't <br>
apply in this case. That wouldn't have been a very convincing argu-ment, <br>
I don't believe, having read it made by others, and having tried <br>
to make it myself. But it at least would have been an act of integrity. <br>
These justices in particular have repeatedly said that the proper mode <br>
of interpreting the Constitution is "originalism"&mdash;to first understand <br>
the framers' text, interpreted in their context, in light of the structure <br>
of the Constitution. That method had produced <i>Lopez </i>and many other <br>
"originalist" rulings. Where was their "originalism" now? <br>
Here, they had joined an opinion that never once tried to explain <br>
what the framers had meant by crafting the Progress Clause as they <br>
did; they joined an opinion that never once tried to explain how the <br>
structure of that clause would affect the interpretation of Congress's <br>

power. And they joined an opinion that didn't even try to explain why <br>
this grant of power could be unlimited, whereas the Commerce Clause <br>
would be limited. In short, they had joined an opinion that did not ap-ply <br>
to, and was inconsistent with, their own method for interpreting <br>
the Constitution. This opinion may well have yielded a result that they <br>
liked. It did not produce a reason that was consistent with their own <br>
principles. <br>
My anger with the Conservatives quickly yielded to anger with my-self. <br>
For I had let a view of the law that I liked interfere with a view of <br>
the law as it is. <br>
Most lawyers, and most law professors, have little patience for ide-alism <br>
about courts in general and this Supreme Court in particular. <br>
Most have a much more pragmatic view. When Don Ayer said that <br>
this case would be won based on whether I could convince the Justices <br>
that the framers' values were important, I fought the idea, because I <br>
didn't want to believe that that is how this Court decides. I insisted on <br>
arguing this case as if it were a simple application of a set of principles. <br>
I had an argument that followed in logic. I didn't need to waste my <br>
time showing it should also follow in popularity. <br>
As I read back over the transcript from that argument in October, I <br>
can see a hundred places where the answers could have taken the con-versation <br>
in different directions, where the truth about the harm that <br>
this unchecked power will cause could have been made clear to this <br>
Court. Justice Kennedy in good faith wanted to be shown. I, idiotically, <br>
corrected his question. Justice Souter in good faith wanted to be shown <br>
the First Amendment harms. I, like a math teacher, reframed the ques-tion <br>
to make the logical point. I had shown them how they could strike <br>
this law of Congress if they wanted to. There were a hundred places <br>
where I could have helped them want to, yet my stubbornness, my re-fusal <br>
to give in, stopped me. I have stood before hundreds of audiences <br>
trying to persuade; I have used passion in that effort to persuade; but I <br>
refused to stand before this audience and try to persuade with the pas-244 <br>

sion I had used elsewhere. It was not the basis on which a court should <br>
decide the issue. <br>
Would it have been different if I had argued it differently? Would it <br>
have been different if Don Ayer had argued it? Or Charles Fried? Or <br>
Kathleen Sullivan? <br>
My friends huddled around me to insist it would not. The Court <br>
was not ready, my friends insisted. This was a loss that was destined. It <br>
would take a great deal more to show our society why our framers were <br>
right. And when we do that, we will be able to show that Court. <br>
Maybe, but I doubt it. These Justices have no financial interest in <br>
doing anything except the right thing. They are not lobbied. They have <br>
little reason to resist doing right. I can't help but think that if I had <br>
stepped down from this pretty picture of dispassionate justice, I could <br>
have persuaded. <br>
And even if I couldn't, then that doesn't excuse what happened in <br>
January. For at the start of this case, one of America's leading intellec-tual <br>
property professors stated publicly that my bringing this case was <br>
a mistake. "The Court is not ready," Peter Jaszi said; this issue should <br>

After the argument and after the decision, Peter said to me, and <br>
publicly, that he was wrong. But if indeed that Court could not have <br>
been persuaded, then that is all the evidence that's needed to know that <br>
here again Peter was right. Either I was not ready to argue this case in <br>
a way that would do some good or they were not ready to hear this case <br>
in a way that would do some good. Either way, the decision to bring <br>
this case&mdash;a decision I had made four years before&mdash;was wrong. <br>

<tt>While the reaction </tt>to the Sonny Bono Act itself was almost <br>
unanimously negative, the reaction to the Court's decision was mixed. <br>

copyright was a good idea. We had won that battle over ideas. Where <br>

the decision was praised, it was praised by papers that had been skep-tical <br>
of the Court's activism in other cases. Deference was a good thing, <br>
even if it left standing a silly law. But where the decision was attacked, <br>
it was attacked because it left standing a silly and harmful law. <i>The New <br>
York Times </i>wrote in its editorial, <br>
</p><p>
In effect, the Supreme Court's decision makes it likely that we are <br>
seeing the beginning of the end of public domain and the birth of <br>
copyright perpetuity. The public domain has been a grand exper-iment, <br>
one that should not be allowed to die. The ability to draw <br>
freely on the entire creative output of humanity is one of the rea-sons <br>
we live in a time of such fruitful creative ferment. <br>

The best responses were in the cartoons. There was a gaggle of hi-larious <br>
images&mdash;of Mickey in jail and the like. The best, from my view <br>
of the case, was Ruben Bolling's, reproduced on the next page. The <br>
"powerful and wealthy" line is a bit unfair. But the punch in the face felt <br>
exactly like that. <br>
The image that will always stick in my head is that evoked by the <br>
quote from <i>The New York Times. </i>That "grand experiment" we call the <br>
"public domain" is over? When I can make light of it, I think, "Honey, <br>
I shrunk the Constitution." But I can rarely make light of it. We had in <br>
our Constitution a commitment to free culture. In the case that I fa-thered, <br>
the Supreme Court effectively renounced that commitment. A <br>
better lawyer would have made them see differently. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER FOURTEEN: Eldred II <br>
The day </tt><i>Eldred </i>was decided, fate would have it that I was to travel to <br>
Washington, D. C. (The day the rehearing petition in <i>Eldred </i>was de-nied&mdash;<br>
meaning the case was really finally over&mdash;fate would have it that <br>
I was giving a speech to technologists at Disney World.) This was a <br>
particularly long flight to my least favorite city. The drive into the city <br>
from Dulles was delayed because of traffic, so I opened up my com-puter <br>
and wrote an op-ed piece. <br>
It was an act of contrition. During the whole of the flight from San <br>
Francisco to Washington, I had heard over and over again in my head <br>
the same advice from Don Ayer: You need to make them see why it is <br>
important. And alternating with that command was the question of <br>
Justice Kennedy: "For all these years the act has impeded progress in <br>
science and the useful arts. I just don't see any empirical evidence for <br>
that." And so, having failed in the argument of constitutional principle, <br>
finally, I turned to an argument of politics. <br>
<i>The New York Times </i>published the piece. In it, I proposed a simple <br>
fix: Fifty years after a work has been published, the copyright owner <br>

would be required to register the work and pay a small fee. If he paid <br>
the fee, he got the benefit of the full term of copyright. If he did not, <br>
the work passed into the public domain. <br>
We called this the Eldred Act, but that was just to give it a name. <br>
Eric Eldred was kind enough to let his name be used once again, but as <br>
he said early on, it won't get passed unless it has another name. <br>
Or another two names. For depending upon your perspective, this <br>
is either the "Public Domain Enhancement Act" or the "Copyright <br>
Term Deregulation Act." Either way, the essence of the idea is clear <br>
and obvious: Remove copyright where it is doing nothing except <br>
blocking access and the spread of knowledge. Leave it for as long as <br>
Congress allows for those works where its worth is at least $1. But for <br>
everything else, let the content go. <br>
The reaction to this idea was amazingly strong. Steve Forbes en-dorsed <br>
it in an editorial. I received an avalanche of e-mail and letters <br>
expressing support. When you focus the issue on lost creativity, people <br>
can see the copyright system makes no sense. As a good Republican <br>
might say, here government regulation is simply getting in the way of <br>
innovation and creativity. And as a good Democrat might say, here the <br>
government is blocking access and the spread of knowledge for no <br>
good reason. Indeed, there is no real difference between Democrats <br>
and Republicans on this issue. Anyone can recognize the stupid harm <br>
of the present system. <br>
Indeed, many recognized the obvious benefit of the registration re-quirement. <br>
For one of the hardest things about the current system for <br>
people who want to license content is that there is no obvious place to <br>
look for the current copyright owners. Since registration is not re-quired, <br>
since marking content is not required, since no formality at all <br>
is required, it is often impossibly hard to locate copyright owners to ask <br>
permission to use or license their work. This system would lower these <br>
costs, by establishing at least one registry where copyright owners <br>
could be identified. <br>
As I described in chapter 10, formalities in copyright law were re-BALANCES <br>

moved in 1976, when Congress followed the Europeans by abandon-ing <br>
any formal requirement before a copyright is granted. 1 The Euro-peans <br>
are said to view copyright as a "natural right." Natural rights <br>
don't need forms to exist. Traditions, like the Anglo-American tradi-tion <br>
that required copyright owners to follow form if their rights were <br>
to be protected, did not, the Europeans thought, properly respect the <br>
dignity of the author. My right as a creator turns on my creativity, not <br>
upon the special favor of the government. <br>
That's great rhetoric. It sounds wonderfully romantic. But it is ab-surd <br>
copyright policy. It is absurd especially for authors, because a <br>
world without formalities harms the creator. The ability to spread <br>
"Walt Disney creativity" is destroyed when there is no simple way to <br>
know what's protected and what's not. <br>
The fight against formalities achieved its first real victory in Berlin <br>
in 1908. International copyright lawyers amended the Berne Conven-tion <br>
in 1908, to require copyright terms of life plus fifty years, as well as <br>
the abolition of copyright formalities. The formalities were hated be-cause <br>
the stories of inadvertent loss were increasingly common. It was <br>
as if a Charles Dickens character ran all copyright offices, and the fail-ure <br>
to dot an <i>i </i>or cross a <i>t </i>resulted in the loss of widows' only income. <br>
These complaints were real and sensible. And the strictness of the <br>
formalities, especially in the United States, was absurd. The law should <br>
always have ways of forgiving innocent mistakes. There is no reason <br>
copyright law couldn't, as well. Rather than abandoning formalities to-tally, <br>
the response in Berlin should have been to embrace a more equi-table <br>
system of registration. <br>
Even that would have been resisted, however, because registration <br>
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was still expensive. It was <br>
also a hassle. The abolishment of formalities promised not only to save <br>
the starving widows, but also to lighten an unnecessary regulatory bur-den <br>
imposed upon creators. <br>
In addition to the practical complaint of authors in 1908, there was <br>
a moral claim as well. There was no reason that creative property <br>

should be a second-class form of property. If a carpenter builds a table, <br>
his rights over the table don't depend upon filing a form with the gov-ernment. <br>
He has a property right over the table "naturally," and he can <br>
assert that right against anyone who would steal the table, whether or <br>
not he has informed the government of his ownership of the table. <br>
This argument is correct, but its implications are misleading. For <br>
the argument in favor of formalities does not depend upon creative <br>
property being second-class property. The argument in favor of for-malities <br>
turns upon the special problems that creative property pres-ents. <br>
The law of formalities responds to the special physics of creative <br>
property, to assure that it can be efficiently and fairly spread. <br>
No one thinks, for example, that land is second-class property just <br>
because you have to register a deed with a court if your sale of land is <br>
to be effective. And few would think a car is second-class property just <br>
because you must register the car with the state and tag it with a li-cense. <br>
In both of those cases, everyone sees that there is an important <br>
reason to secure registration&mdash;both because it makes the markets more <br>
efficient and because it better secures the rights of the owner. Without <br>
a registration system for land, landowners would perpetually have to <br>
guard their property. With registration, they can simply point the po-lice <br>
to a deed. Without a registration system for cars, auto theft would <br>
be much easier. With a registration system, the thief has a high burden <br>
to sell a stolen car. A slight burden is placed on the property owner, but <br>
those burdens produce a much better system of protection for property <br>
generally. <br>
It is similarly special physics that makes formalities important in <br>
copyright law. Unlike a carpenter's table, there's nothing in nature that <br>
makes it relatively obvious who might own a particular bit of creative <br>
property. A recording of Lyle Lovett's latest album can exist in a billion <br>
places without anything necessarily linking it back to a particular <br>
owner. And like a car, there's no way to buy and sell creative property <br>
with confidence unless there is some simple way to authenticate who is <br>
the author and what rights he has. Simple transactions are destroyed in <br>

a world without formalities. Complex, expensive, <i>lawyer </i>transactions <br>
take their place. <br>
This was the understanding of the problem with the Sonny Bono <br>
Act that we tried to demonstrate to the Court. This was the part it <br>
didn't "get." Because we live in a system without formalities, there is no <br>
way easily to build upon or use culture from our past. If copyright <br>
terms were, as Justice Story said they would be, "short," then this <br>
wouldn't matter much. For fourteen years, under the framers' system, a <br>
work would be presumptively controlled. After fourteen years, it would <br>
be presumptively uncontrolled. <br>
But now that copyrights can be just about a century long, the in-ability <br>
to know what is protected and what is not protected becomes a <br>
huge and obvious burden on the creative process. If the only way a li-brary <br>
can offer an Internet exhibit about the New Deal is to hire a <br>
lawyer to clear the rights to every image and sound, then the copyright <br>
system is burdening creativity in a way that has never been seen before <br>
<i>because there are no formalities. <br>
</i>The Eldred Act was designed to respond to exactly this problem. If <br>
it is worth $1 to you, then register your work and you can get the <br>
longer term. Others will know how to contact you and, therefore, how <br>
to get your permission if they want to use your work. And you will get <br>
the benefit of an extended copyright term. <br>
If it isn't worth it to you to register to get the benefit of an extended <br>
term, then it shouldn't be worth it for the government to defend your <br>
monopoly over that work either. The work should pass into the public <br>
domain where anyone can copy it, or build archives with it, or create a <br>
movie based on it. It should become free if it is not worth $1 to you. <br>
Some worry about the burden on authors. Won't the burden of reg-istering <br>
the work mean that the $1 is really misleading? Isn't the hassle <br>
worth more than $1? Isn't that the real problem with registration? <br>
It is. The hassle is terrible. The system that exists now is awful. I <br>
completely agree that the Copyright Office has done a terrible job (no <br>
doubt because they are terribly funded) in enabling simple and cheap <br>

registrations. Any real solution to the problem of formalities must ad-dress <br>
the real problem of <i>governments </i>standing at the core of any sys-tem <br>
of formalities. In this book, I offer such a solution. That solution <br>
essentially remakes the Copyright Office. For now, assume it was <br>
Amazon that ran the registration system. Assume it was one-click reg-istration. <br>
The Eldred Act would propose a simple, one-click registra-tion <br>
fifty years after a work was published. Based upon historical data, <br>
that system would move up to 98 percent of commercial work, com-mercial <br>
work that no longer had a commercial life, into the public do-main <br>
within fifty years. What do you think? <br>
</p><p>
<tt>When Steve Forbes </tt>endorsed the idea, some in Washington began <br>
to pay attention. Many people contacted me pointing to representa-tives <br>
who might be willing to introduce the Eldred Act. And I had a few <br>
who directly suggested that they might be willing to take the first step. <br>
One representative, Zoe Lofgren of California, went so far as to get <br>
the bill drafted. The draft solved any problem with international law. It <br>
imposed the simplest requirement upon copyright owners possible. In <br>
May 2003, it looked as if the bill would be introduced. On May 16, I <br>
posted on the Eldred Act blog, "we are close." There was a general reac-tion <br>
in the blog community that something good might happen here. <br>
But at this stage, the lobbyists began to intervene. Jack Valenti and <br>
the MPAA general counsel came to the congresswoman's office to <br>
give the view of the MPAA. Aided by his lawyer, as Valenti told me, <br>
Valenti informed the congresswoman that the MPAA would oppose <br>
the Eldred Act. The reasons are embarrassingly thin. More importantly, <br>
their thinness shows something clear about what this debate is re-ally <br>
about. <br>
The MPAA argued first that Congress had "firmly rejected the cen-tral <br>
concept in the proposed bill"&mdash;that copyrights be renewed. That <br>
was true, but irrelevant, as Congress's "firm rejection" had occurred <br>
long before the Internet made subsequent uses much more likely. Sec-BALANCES <br>

<br>
</p><p>
ond, they argued that the proposal would harm poor copyright own-ers&mdash;<br>
apparently those who could not afford the $1 fee. Third, they ar-gued <br>
that Congress had determined that extending a copyright term <br>
would encourage restoration work. Maybe in the case of the small per-centage <br>
of work covered by copyright law that is still commercially <br>
valuable, but again this was irrelevant, as the proposal would not cut off <br>
the extended term unless the $1 fee was not paid. Fourth, the MPAA <br>
argued that the bill would impose "enormous" costs, since a registration <br>
system is not free. True enough, but those costs are certainly less than <br>
the costs of clearing the rights for a copyright whose owner is not <br>
known. Fifth, they worried about the risks if the copyright to a story <br>
underlying a film were to pass into the public domain. But what risk is <br>
that? If it is in the public domain, then the film is a valid derivative use. <br>
Finally, the MPAA argued that existing law enabled copyright <br>
owners to do this if they wanted. But the whole point is that there are <br>
thousands of copyright owners who don't even know they have a copy-right <br>
to give. Whether they are free to give away their copyright or <br>
not&mdash;a controversial claim in any case&mdash;unless they know about a <br>
copyright, they're not likely to. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>At the beginning </tt>of this book, I told two stories about the law re-acting <br>
to changes in technology. In the one, common sense prevailed. <br>
In the other, common sense was delayed. The difference between the <br>
two stories was the power of the opposition&mdash;the power of the side that <br>
fought to defend the status quo. In both cases, a new technology threat-ened <br>
old interests. But in only one case did those interest's have the <br>
power to protect themselves against this new competitive threat. <br>
I used these two cases as a way to frame the war that this book has <br>
been about. For here, too, a new technology is forcing the law to react. <br>
And here, too, we should ask, is the law following or resisting common <br>
sense? If common sense supports the law, what explains this common <br>
sense? <br>

When the issue is piracy, it is right for the law to back the copyright <br>
owners. The commercial piracy that I described is wrong and harmful, <br>
and the law should work to eliminate it. When the issue is p2p shar-ing, <br>
it is easy to understand why the law backs the owners still: Much <br>
of this sharing is wrong, even if much is harmless. When the issue is <br>
copyright terms for the Mickey Mouses of the world, it is possible still <br>
to understand why the law favors Hollywood: Most people don't rec-ognize <br>
the reasons for limiting copyright terms; it is thus still possible <br>
to see good faith within the resistance. <br>
But when the copyright owners oppose a proposal such as the El-dred <br>
Act, then, finally, there is an example that lays bare the naked self-interest <br>
driving this war. This act would free an extraordinary range of <br>
content that is otherwise unused. It wouldn't interfere with any copy-right <br>
owner's desire to exercise continued control over his content. It <br>
would simply liberate what Kevin Kelly calls the "Dark Content" that <br>
fills archives around the world. So when the warriors oppose a change <br>
like this, we should ask one simple question: <br>
What does this industry really want? <br>
With very little effort, the warriors could protect their content. So <br>
the effort to block something like the Eldred Act is not really about <br>
protecting <i>their </i>content. The effort to block the Eldred Act is an effort <br>
to assure that nothing more passes into the public domain. It is another <br>
step to assure that the public domain will never compete, that there <br>
will be no use of content that is not commercially controlled, and that <br>
there will be no commercial use of content that doesn't require <i>their <br>
</i>permission first. <br>
The opposition to the Eldred Act reveals how extreme the other <br>
side is. The most powerful and sexy and well loved of lobbies really has <br>
as its aim not the protection of "property" but the rejection of a tradi-tion. <br>
Their aim is not simply to protect what is theirs. <i>Their aim is to as-sure <br>
that all there is is what is theirs. <br>
</i>It is not hard to understand why the warriors take this view. It is not <br>
hard to see why it would benefit them if the competition of the public <br>

domain tied to the Internet could somehow be quashed. Just as RCA <br>
feared the competition of FM, they fear the competition of a public <br>
domain connected to a public that now has the means to create with it <br>
and to share its own creation. <br>
What is hard to understand is why the public takes this view. It is <br>
as if the law made airplanes trespassers. The MPAA stands with the <br>
Causbys and demands that their remote and useless property rights be <br>
respected, so that these remote and forgotten copyright holders might <br>
block the progress of others. <br>
All this seems to follow easily from this untroubled acceptance of <br>
the "property" in intellectual property. Common sense supports it, and <br>
so long as it does, the assaults will rain down upon the technologies of <br>
the Internet. The consequence will be an increasing "permission soci-ety." <br>
The past can be cultivated only if you can identify the owner and <br>
gain permission to build upon his work. The future will be controlled <br>
by this dead (and often unfindable) hand of the past. <br>

<tt>CONCLUSION <br>
There are more </tt>than 35 million people with the AIDS virus <br>
worldwide. Twenty-five million of them live in sub-Saharan Africa. <br>
Seventeen million have already died. Seventeen million Africans <br>
is proportional percentage-wise to seven million Americans. More <br>
importantly, it is seventeen million Africans. <br>
There is no cure for AIDS, but there are drugs to slow its progres-sion. <br>
These antiretroviral therapies are still experimental, but they have <br>
already had a dramatic effect. In the United States, AIDS patients who <br>
regularly take a cocktail of these drugs increase their life expectancy <br>
by ten to twenty years. For some, the drugs make the disease almost <br>
invisible. <br>
These drugs are expensive. When they were first introduced in the <br>
United States, they cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per person per <br>
year. Today, some cost $25,000 per year. At these prices, of course, no <br>
African nation can afford the drugs for the vast majority of its popula-tion: <br>
$15,000 is thirty times the per capita gross national product of <br>
Zimbabwe. At these prices, the drugs are totally unavailable. 1 <br>

<br>
</p><p>
These prices are not high because the ingredients of the drugs are <br>
expensive. These prices are high because the drugs are protected by <br>
patents. The drug companies that produced these life-saving mixes en-joy <br>
at least a twenty-year monopoly for their inventions. They use that <br>
monopoly power to extract the most they can from the market. That <br>
power is in turn used to keep the prices high. <br>
There are many who are skeptical of patents, especially drug <br>
patents. I am not. Indeed, of all the areas of research that might be sup-ported <br>
by patents, drug research is, in my view, the clearest case where <br>
patents are needed. The patent gives the drug company some assurance <br>
that if it is successful in inventing a new drug to treat a disease, it will <br>
be able to earn back its investment and more. This is socially an ex-tremely <br>
valuable incentive. I am the last person who would argue that <br>
the law should abolish it, at least without other changes. <br>
But it is one thing to support patents, even drug patents. It is an-other <br>
thing to determine how best to deal with a crisis. And as African <br>
leaders began to recognize the devastation that AIDS was bringing, <br>
they started looking for ways to import HIV treatments at costs signif-icantly <br>
below the market price. <br>
In 1997, South Africa tried one tack. It passed a law to allow the <br>
importation of patented medicines that had been produced or sold in <br>
another nation's market with the consent of the patent owner. For ex-ample, <br>
if the drug was sold in India, it could be imported into Africa <br>
from India. This is called "parallel importation," and it is generally per-mitted <br>
under international trade law and is specifically permitted <br>
within the European Union. 2 <br>
However, the United States government opposed the bill. Indeed, <br>
more than opposed. As the International Intellectual Property Associ-ation <br>
characterized it, "The U. S. government pressured South Africa . . . <br>

tions. That same year, more than forty pharmaceutical companies be-gan <br>
proceedings in the South African courts to challenge the govern-ment's <br>
actions. The United States was then joined by other governments <br>
from the EU. Their claim, and the claim of the pharmaceutical compa-nies, <br>
was that South Africa was violating its obligations under inter-national <br>
law by discriminating against a particular kind of patent&mdash;<br>
pharmaceutical patents. The demand of these governments, with the <br>
United States in the lead, was that South Africa respect these patents <br>
as it respects any other patent, regardless of any effect on the treatment <br>
of AIDS within South Africa. 4 <br>
We should place the intervention by the United States in context. <br>
No doubt patents are not the most important reason that Africans <br>
don't have access to drugs. Poverty and the total absence of an effective <br>
health care infrastructure matter more. But whether patents are the <br>
most important reason or not, the price of drugs has an effect on their <br>
demand, and patents affect price. And so, whether massive or mar-ginal, <br>
there was an effect from our government's intervention to stop <br>
the flow of medications into Africa. <br>
By stopping the flow of HIV treatment into Africa, the United <br>
States government was not saving drugs for United States citizens. <br>
This is not like wheat (if they eat it, we can't); instead, the flow that the <br>
United States intervened to stop was, in effect, a flow of knowledge: <br>
information about how to take chemicals that exist within Africa, and <br>
turn those chemicals into drugs that would save 15 to 30 million lives. <br>
Nor was the intervention by the United States going to protect the <br>
profits of United States drug companies&mdash;at least, not substantially. It <br>
was not as if these countries were in the position to buy the drugs for <br>
the prices the drug companies were charging. Again, the Africans are <br>
wildly too poor to afford these drugs at the offered prices. Stopping the <br>
parallel import of these drugs would not substantially increase the sales <br>
by U. S. companies. <br>
Instead, the argument in favor of restricting this flow of informa-tion, <br>
which was needed to save the lives of millions, was an argument <br>

about the sanctity of property. 5 It was because "intellectual property" <br>
would be violated that these drugs should not flow into Africa. It was <br>
a principle about the importance of "intellectual property" that led <br>
these government actors to intervene against the South African re-sponse <br>
to AIDS. <br>
Now just step back for a moment. There will be a time thirty years <br>
from now when our children look back at us and ask, how could we have <br>
let this happen? How could we allow a policy to be pursued whose di-rect <br>
cost would be to speed the death of 15 to 30 million Africans, and <br>
whose only real benefit would be to uphold the "sanctity" of an idea? <br>
What possible justification could there ever be for a policy that results <br>
in so many deaths? What exactly is the insanity that would allow so <br>
many to die for such an abstraction? <br>
Some blame the drug companies. I don't. They are corporations. <br>
Their managers are ordered by law to make money for the corporation. <br>
They push a certain patent policy not because of ideals, but because it is <br>
the policy that makes them the most money. And it only makes them the <br>
most money because of a certain corruption within our political system&mdash;<br>
a corruption the drug companies are certainly not responsible for. <br>
The corruption is our own politicians' failure of integrity. For the <br>
drug companies would love&mdash;they say, and I believe them&mdash;to sell their <br>
drugs as cheaply as they can to countries in Africa and elsewhere. <br>
There are issues they'd have to resolve to make sure the drugs didn't get <br>
back into the United States, but those are mere problems of technol-ogy. <br>
They could be overcome. <br>
A different problem, however, could not be overcome. This is the <br>
fear of the grandstanding politician who would call the presidents of <br>
the drug companies before a Senate or House hearing, and ask, "How <br>
is it you can sell this HIV drug in Africa for only $1 a pill, but the same <br>
drug would cost an American $1,500?" Because there is no "sound <br>
bite" answer to that question, its effect would be to induce regulation <br>
of prices in America. The drug companies thus avoid this spiral by <br>
avoiding the first step. They reinforce the idea that property should be <br>

sacred. They adopt a rational strategy in an irrational context, with the <br>
unintended consequence that perhaps millions die. And that rational <br>
strategy thus becomes framed in terms of this ideal&mdash;the sanctity of an <br>
idea called "intellectual property." <br>
So when the common sense of your child confronts you, what will <br>
you say? When the common sense of a generation finally revolts <br>
against what we have done, how will we justify what we have done? <br>
What is the argument? <br>
A sensible patent policy could endorse and strongly support the <br>
patent system without having to reach everyone everywhere in exactly <br>
the same way. Just as a sensible copyright policy could endorse and <br>
strongly support a copyright system without having to regulate the <br>
spread of culture perfectly and forever, a sensible patent policy could <br>
endorse and strongly support a patent system without having to block <br>
the spread of drugs to a country not rich enough to afford market <br>
prices in any case. A sensible policy, in other words, could be a balanced <br>
policy. For most of our history, both copyright and patent policies were <br>
balanced in just this sense. <br>
But we as a culture have lost this sense of balance. We have lost the <br>
critical eye that helps us see the difference between truth and extrem-ism. <br>
A certain property fundamentalism, having no connection to our <br>
tradition, now reigns in this culture&mdash;bizarrely, and with consequences <br>
more grave to the spread of ideas and culture than almost any other <br>
single policy decision that we as a democracy will make. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>A simple idea </tt>blinds us, and under the cover of darkness, much <br>
happens that most of us would reject if any of us looked. So uncritically <br>
do we accept the idea of property in ideas that we don't even notice <br>
how monstrous it is to deny ideas to a people who are dying without <br>
them. So uncritically do we accept the idea of property in culture that <br>
we don't even question when the control of that property removes our <br>
ability, as a people, to develop our culture democratically. Blindness be-CONCLUSION <br>

comes our common sense. And the challenge for anyone who would <br>
reclaim the right to cultivate our culture is to find a way to make this <br>
common sense open its eyes. <br>
So far, common sense sleeps. There is no revolt. Common sense <br>
does not yet see what there could be to revolt about. The extremism <br>
that now dominates this debate fits with ideas that seem natural, and <br>
that fit is reinforced by the RCAs of our day. They wage a frantic war <br>
to fight "piracy," and devastate a culture for creativity. They defend <br>
the idea of "creative property," while transforming real creators into <br>
modern-day sharecroppers. They are insulted by the idea that rights <br>
should be balanced, even though each of the major players in this <br>
content war was itself a beneficiary of a more balanced ideal. The <br>
hypocrisy reeks. Yet in a city like Washington, hypocrisy is not even <br>
noticed. Powerful lobbies, complex issues, and MTV attention spans <br>
produce the "perfect storm" for free culture. <br>

<tt>In August 2003, </tt>a fight broke out in the United States about a <br>
decision by the World Intellectual Property Organization to cancel a <br>
meeting. 6 At the request of a wide range of interests, WIPO had de-cided <br>
to hold a meeting to discuss "open and collaborative projects to <br>
create public goods." These are projects that have been successful in <br>
producing public goods without relying exclusively upon a proprietary <br>
use of intellectual property. Examples include the Internet and the <br>
Wor ld Wide Web, both of which were developed on the basis of pro-tocols <br>
in the public domain. It included an emerging trend to support <br>
open academic journals, including the Public Library of Science proj-ect <br>
that I describe in the Afterword. It included a project to develop <br>
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are thought to have <br>
great significance in biomedical research. (That nonprofit project com-prised <br>
a consortium of the Wellcome Trust and pharmaceutical and <br>
technological companies, including Amersham Biosciences, AstraZeneca, <br>

IBM, Motorola, Novartis, Pfizer, and Searle.) It included <br>
the Global Positioning System, which Ronald Reagan set free in the <br>
early 1980s. And it included "open source and free software." <br>
The aim of the meeting was to consider this wide range of projects <br>
from one common perspective: that none of these projects relied upon <br>
intellectual property extremism. Instead, in all of them, intellectual <br>
property was balanced by agreements to keep access open or to impose <br>
limitations on the way in which proprietary claims might be used. <br>
From the perspective of this book, then, the conference was ideal. 7 <br>
The projects within its scope included both commercial and noncom-mercial <br>
work. They primarily involved science, but from many per-spectives. <br>
And WIPO was an ideal venue for this discussion, since <br>
WIPO is the preeminent international body dealing with intellectual <br>
property issues. <br>
Indeed, I was once publicly scolded for not recognizing this fact <br>
about WIPO. In February 2003, I delivered a keynote address to a <br>
preparatory conference for the World Summit on the Information So-ciety <br>
(WSIS). At a press conference before the address, I was asked <br>
what I would say. I responded that I would be talking a little about the <br>
importance of balance in intellectual property for the development of <br>
an information society. The moderator for the event then promptly in-terrupted <br>
to inform me and the assembled reporters that no question <br>
about intellectual property would be discussed by WSIS, since those <br>
questions were the exclusive domain of WIPO. In the talk that I had <br>
prepared, I had actually made the issue of intellectual property rela-tively <br>
minor. But after this astonishing statement, I made intellectual <br>
property the sole focus of my talk. There was no way to talk about an <br>
"Information Society" unless one also talked about the range of infor-mation <br>
and culture that would be free. My talk did not make my im-moderate <br>
moderator very happy. And she was no doubt correct that the <br>
scope of intellectual property protections was ordinarily the stuff of <br>

WIPO. But in my view, there couldn't be too much of a conversation <br>
about how much intellectual property is needed, since in my view, the <br>
very idea of balance in intellectual property had been lost. <br>
So whether or not WSIS can discuss balance in intellectual prop-erty, <br>
I had thought it was taken for granted that WIPO could and <br>
should. And thus the meeting about "open and collaborative projects to <br>
create public goods" seemed perfectly appropriate within the WIPO <br>
agenda. <br>
But there is one project within that list that is highly controversial, <br>
at least among lobbyists. That project is "open source and free soft-ware." <br>
Microsoft in particular is wary of discussion of the subject. From <br>
its perspective, a conference to discuss open source and free software <br>
would be like a conference to discuss Apple's operating system. Both <br>
open source and free software compete with Microsoft's software. And <br>
internationally, many governments have begun to explore requirements <br>
that they use open source or free software, rather than "proprietary <br>
software," for their own internal uses. <br>
I don't mean to enter that debate here. It is important only to make <br>
clear that the distinction is not between commercial and noncommer-cial <br>
software. There are many important companies that depend fun-damentally <br>
upon open source and free software, IBM being the most <br>
prominent. IBM is increasingly shifting its focus to the GNU/ Linux <br>
operating system, the most famous bit of "free software"&mdash;and IBM is <br>
emphatically a commercial entity. Thus, to support "open source and <br>
free software" is not to oppose commercial entities. It is, instead, to <br>
support a mode of software development that is different from Mi-crosoft's. 8 <br>
</p><p>
More important for our purposes, to support "open source and free <br>
software" is not to oppose copyright. "Open source and free soft-ware" <br>
is not software in the public domain. Instead, like Microsoft's <br>
software, the copyright owners of free and open source software insist <br>
quite strongly that the terms of their software license be respected by <br>

adopters of free and open source software. The terms of that license are <br>
no doubt different from the terms of a proprietary software license. <br>
Free software licensed under the General Public License (GPL), for <br>
example, requires that the source code for the software be made avail-able <br>
by anyone who modifies and redistributes the software. But that <br>
requirement is effective only if copyright governs software. If copyright <br>
did not govern software, then free software could not impose the same <br>
kind of requirements on its adopters. It thus depends upon copyright <br>
law just as Microsoft does. <br>
It is therefore understandable that as a proprietary software devel-oper, <br>
Microsoft would oppose this WIPO meeting, and understand-able <br>
that it would use its lobbyists to get the United States government <br>
to oppose it, as well. And indeed, that is just what was reported to have <br>
happened. According to Jonathan Krim of the <i>Washington Post, </i>Mi-crosoft's <br>
lobbyists succeeded in getting the United States government <br>
to veto the meeting. 9 And without U. S. backing, the meeting was can-celed. <br>
</p><p>
I don't blame Microsoft for doing what it can to advance its own in-terests, <br>
consistent with the law. And lobbying governments is plainly <br>
consistent with the law. There was nothing surprising about its lobby-ing <br>
here, and nothing terribly surprising about the most powerful soft-ware <br>
producer in the United States having succeeded in its lobbying <br>
efforts. <br>
What was surprising was the United States government's reason for <br>
opposing the meeting. Again, as reported by Krim, Lois Boland, acting <br>
director of international relations for the U. S. Patent and Trademark <br>
Office, explained that "open-source software runs counter to the mis-sion <br>
of WIPO, which is to promote intellectual-property rights." She <br>
is quoted as saying, "To hold a meeting which has as its purpose to dis-claim <br>
or waive such rights seems to us to be contrary to the goals of <br>
WIPO." <br>
These statements are astonishing on a number of levels. <br>

<br>
</p><p>
First, they are just flat wrong. As I described, most open source and <br>
free software relies fundamentally upon the intellectual property right <br>
called "copyright." Without it, restrictions imposed by those licenses <br>
wouldn't work. Thus, to say it "runs counter" to the mission of promot-ing <br>
intellectual property rights reveals an extraordinary gap in under-standing&mdash;<br>
the sort of mistake that is excusable in a first-year law <br>
student, but an embarrassment from a high government official deal-ing <br>
with intellectual property issues. <br>
Second, who ever said that WIPO's exclusive aim was to "promote" <br>
intellectual property maximally? As I had been scolded at the prepara-tory <br>
conference of WSIS, WIPO is to consider not only how best to <br>
protect intellectual property, but also what the best balance of intellec-tual <br>
property is. As every economist and lawyer knows, the hard ques-tion <br>
in intellectual property law is to find that balance. But that there <br>
should be limits is, I had thought, uncontested. One wants to ask Ms. <br>
Boland, are generic drugs (drugs based on drugs whose patent has <br>
expired) contrary to the WIPO mission? Does the public domain <br>
weaken intellectual property? Would it have been better if the proto-cols <br>
of the Internet had been patented? <br>
Third, even if one believed that the purpose of WIPO was to max-imize <br>
intellectual property rights, in our tradition, intellectual property <br>
rights are held by individuals and corporations. They get to decide <br>
what to do with those rights because, again, they are <i>their </i>rights. If they <br>
want to "waive" or "disclaim" their rights, that is, within our tradition, <br>
totally appropriate. When Bill Gates gives away more than $20 billion <br>
to do good in the world, that is not inconsistent with the objectives of <br>
the property system. That is, on the contrary, just what a property sys-tem <br>
is supposed to be about: giving individuals the right to decide what <br>
to do with <i>their </i>property. <br>
When Ms. Boland says that there is something wrong with a meet-ing <br>
"which has as its purpose to disclaim or waive such rights," she's <br>
saying that WIPO has an interest in interfering with the choices of <br>

<br>

the individuals who own intellectual property rights. That somehow, <br>
WIPO's objective should be to stop an individual from "waiving" or "dis-claiming" <br>
an intellectual property right. That the interest of WIPO is <br>
not just that intellectual property rights be maximized, but that they also <br>
should be exercised in the most extreme and restrictive way possible. <br>
There is a history of just such a property system that is well known <br>
in the Anglo-American tradition. It is called "feudalism." Under feu-dalism, <br>
not only was property held by a relatively small number of in-dividuals <br>
and entities. And not only were the rights that ran with that <br>
property powerful and extensive. But the feudal system had a strong <br>
interest in assuring that property holders within that system not <br>
weaken feudalism by liberating people or property within their control <br>
to the free market. Feudalism depended upon maximum control and <br>
concentration. It fought any freedom that might interfere with that <br>
control. <br>
As Peter Drahos and John Braithwaite relate, this is precisely the <br>
choice we are now making about intellectual property. 10 We will have <br>
an information society. That much is certain. Our only choice now is <br>
whether that information society will be <i>free </i>or <i>feudal. </i>The trend is to-ward <br>
the feudal. <br>
When this battle broke, I blogged it. A spirited debate within the <br>
comment section ensued. Ms. Boland had a number of supporters who <br>
tried to show why her comments made sense. But there was one com-ment <br>
that was particularly depressing for me. An anonymous poster <br>
wrote, <br>
</p><p>
George, you misunderstand Lessig: He's only talking about the <br>
world as it should be (" the goal of WIPO, and the goal of any <br>
government, should be to promote the right balance of intellectual-property <br>
rights, not simply to promote intellectual property <br>
rights"), not as it is. If we were talking about the world as it is, <br>
then of course Boland didn't say anything wrong. But in the world <br>

</p><p>
as Lessig would have it, then of course she did. Always pay atten-tion <br>
to the distinction between Lessig's world and ours. <br>
</p><p>
I missed the irony the first time I read it. I read it quickly and <br>
thought the poster was supporting the idea that seeking balance was <br>
what our government should be doing. (Of course, my criticism of Ms. <br>
Boland was not about whether she was seeking balance or not; my <br>
criticism was that her comments betrayed a first-year law student's <br>
mistake. I have no illusion about the extremism of our government, <br>
whether Republican or Democrat. My only illusion apparently is about <br>
whether our government should speak the truth or not.) <br>
Obviously, however, the poster was not supporting that idea. In-stead, <br>
the poster was ridiculing the very idea that in the real world, the <br>
"goal" of a government should be "to promote the right balance" of in-tellectual <br>
property. That was obviously silly to him. And it obviously <br>
betrayed, he believed, my own silly utopianism. "Typical for an aca-demic," <br>
the poster might well have continued. <br>
I understand criticism of academic utopianism. I think utopianism <br>
is silly, too, and I'd be the first to poke fun at the absurdly unrealistic <br>
ideals of academics throughout history (and not just in our own coun-try's <br>
history). <br>
But when it has become silly to suppose that the role of our gov-ernment <br>
should be to "seek balance," then count me with the silly, for <br>
that means that this has become quite serious indeed. If it should be <br>
obvious to everyone that the government does not seek balance, that <br>
the government is simply the tool of the most powerful lobbyists, that <br>
the idea of holding the government to a different standard is absurd, <br>
that the idea of demanding of the government that it speak truth and <br>
not lies is just naïve, then who have we, the most powerful democracy <br>
in the world, become? <br>
It might be crazy to expect a high government official to speak <br>
the truth. It might be crazy to believe that government policy will be <br>
something more than the handmaiden of the most powerful interests. <br>

It might be crazy to argue that we should preserve a tradition that has <br>
been part of our tradition for most of our history&mdash;free culture. <br>
If this is crazy, then let there be more crazies. Soon. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>There are moments </tt>of hope in this struggle. And moments that <br>
surprise. When the FCC was considering relaxing ownership rules, <br>
which would thereby further increase the concentration in media own-ership, <br>
an extraordinary bipartisan coalition formed to fight this <br>
change. For perhaps the first time in history, interests as diverse as the <br>
NRA, the ACLU, Moveon. org, William Safire, Ted Turner, and <br>
CodePink Women for Peace organized to oppose this change in FCC <br>
policy. An astonishing 700,000 letters were sent to the FCC, demand-ing <br>
more hearings and a different result. <br>
This activism did not stop the FCC, but soon after, a broad coali-tion <br>
in the Senate voted to reverse the FCC decision. The hostile hear-ings <br>
leading up to that vote revealed just how powerful this movement <br>
had become. There was no substantial support for the FCC's decision, <br>
and there was broad and sustained support for fighting further concen-tration <br>
in the media. <br>
But even this movement misses an important piece of the puzzle. <br>
Largeness as such is not bad. Freedom is not threatened just because <br>
some become very rich, or because there are only a handful of big play-ers. <br>
The poor quality of Big Macs or Quarter Pounders does not mean <br>
that you can't get a good hamburger from somewhere else. <br>
The danger in media concentration comes not from the concentra-tion, <br>
but instead from the feudalism that this concentration, tied to the <br>
change in copyright, produces. It is not just that there are a few power-ful <br>
companies that control an ever expanding slice of the media. It <br>
is that this concentration can call upon an equally bloated range of <br>
rights&mdash;property rights of a historically extreme form&mdash;that makes <br>
their bigness bad. <br>

about bigness alone, it is not terribly surprising. We Americans have a <br>
long history of fighting "big," wisely or not. That we could be moti-vated <br>
to fight "big" again is not something new. <br>

to our tradition; indeed, as I've argued, balance is our tradition. But be-cause <br>
the muscle to think critically about the scope of anything called <br>
"property" is not well exercised within this tradition anymore. <br>
If we were Achilles, this would be our heel. This would be the place <br>
of our tragedy. <br>

<tt>As I write </tt>these final words, the news is filled with stories about <br>
the RIAA lawsuits against almost three hundred individuals. 11 Em-inem <br>
has just been sued for "sampling" someone else's music. 12 The <br>
story about Bob Dylan "stealing" from a Japanese author has just fin-ished <br>
making the rounds. 13 An insider from Hollywood&mdash;who insists <br>
he must remain anonymous&mdash;reports "an amazing conversation with <br>
these studio guys. They've got extraordinary [old] content that they'd <br>
love to use but can't because they can't begin to clear the rights. They've <br>
got scores of kids who could do amazing things with the content, but <br>
it would take scores of lawyers to clean it first." Congressmen are talk-ing <br>
about deputizing computer viruses to bring down computers thought <br>
to violate the law. Universities are threatening expulsion for kids who <br>
use a computer to share content. <br>
Yet on the other side of the Atlantic, the BBC has just announced <br>
that it will build a "Creative Archive," from which British citizens can <br>
download BBC content, and rip, mix, and burn it. 14 And in Brazil, the <br>
culture minister, Gilberto Gil, himself a folk hero of Brazilian music, <br>

I've told a dark story. The truth is more mixed. A technology has <br>
given us a new freedom. Slowly, some begin to understand that this <br>
freedom need not mean anarchy. We can carry a free culture into the <br>
twenty-first century, without artists losing and without the potential of <br>
digital technology being destroyed. It will take some thought, and <br>
more importantly, it will take some will to transform the RCAs of our <br>
day into the Causbys. <br>
Common sense must revolt. It must act to free culture. Soon, if this <br>
potential is ever to be realized. <br>

<tt>At least some </tt>who have read this far will agree with me that some-thing <br>
must be done to change where we are heading. The balance of <br>
this book maps what might be done. <br>
I divide this map into two parts: that which anyone can do now, <br>
and that which requires the help of lawmakers. If there is one lesson <br>
that we can draw from the history of remaking common sense, it is that <br>
it requires remaking how many people think about the very same issue. <br>
That means this movement must begin in the streets. It must re-cruit <br>
a significant number of parents, teachers, librarians, creators, au-thors, <br>
musicians, filmmakers, scientists&mdash;all to tell this story in their <br>
own words, and to tell their neighbors why this battle is so important. <br>
Once this movement has its effect in the streets, it has some hope of <br>
having an effect in Washington. We are still a democracy. What people <br>
think matters. Not as much as it should, at least when an RCA stands <br>
opposed, but still, it matters. And thus, in the second part below, I <br>
sketch changes that Congress could make to better secure a free culture. <br>

<tt>US, NOW <br>
Common sense </tt>is with the copyright warriors because the debate so <br>
far has been framed at the extremes&mdash;as a grand either/ or: either prop-erty <br>
or anarchy, either total control or artists won't be paid. If that re-ally <br>
is the choice, then the warriors should win. <br>
The mistake here is the error of the excluded middle. There are ex-tremes <br>
in this debate, but the extremes are not all that there is. There <br>
are those who believe in maximal copyright&ndash;" All Rights Reserved"&mdash;<br>
and those who reject copyright&ndash;" No Rights Reserved." The "All <br>
Rights Reserved" sorts believe that you should ask permission before <br>
you "use" a copyrighted work in any way. The "No Rights Reserved" <br>
sorts believe you should be able to do with content as you wish, re-gardless <br>
of whether you have permission or not. <br>
When the Internet was first born, its initial architecture effectively <br>
tilted in the "no rights reserved" direction. Content could be copied <br>
perfectly and cheaply; rights could not easily be controlled. Thus, re-gardless <br>
of anyone's desire, the effective regime of copyright under the <br>

original design of the Internet was "no rights reserved." Content was <br>
"taken" regardless of the rights. Any rights were effectively unpro-tected. <br>
</p><p>
This initial character produced a reaction (opposite, but not quite <br>
equal) by copyright owners. That reaction has been the topic of this <br>
book. Through legislation, litigation, and changes to the network's <br>
design, copyright holders have been able to change the essential char-acter <br>
of the environment of the original Internet. If the original archi-tecture <br>
made the effective default "no rights reserved," the future <br>
architecture will make the effective default "all rights reserved." The ar-chitecture <br>
and law that surround the Internet's design will increasingly <br>
produce an environment where all use of content requires permission. <br>
The "cut and paste" world that defines the Internet today will become <br>
a "get permission to cut and paste" world that is a creator's nightmare. <br>
What's needed is a way to say something in the middle&mdash;neither "all <br>
rights reserved" nor "no rights reserved" but "some rights reserved"&mdash;<br>
and thus a way to respect copyrights but enable creators to free content <br>
as they see fit. In other words, we need a way to restore a set of free-doms <br>
that we could just take for granted before. <br>

<tt>Rebuilding Freedoms Previously <br>
Presumed: Examples <br>
</tt></p><p>
If you step back from the battle I've been describing here, you will rec-ognize <br>
this problem from other contexts. Think about privacy. Before <br>
the Internet, most of us didn't have to worry much about data about <br>
our lives that we broadcast to the world. If you walked into a bookstore <br>
and browsed through some of the works of Karl Marx, you didn't need <br>
to worry about explaining your browsing habits to your neighbors or <br>
boss. The "privacy" of your browsing habits was assured. <br>
What made it assured? <br>

<br>
</p><p>
Well, if we think in terms of the modalities I described in chapter <br>
10, your privacy was assured because of an inefficient architecture for <br>
gathering data and hence a market constraint (cost) on anyone who <br>
wanted to gather that data. If you were a suspected spy for North Ko-rea, <br>
working for the CIA, no doubt your privacy would not be assured. <br>
But that's because the CIA would (we hope) find it valuable enough to <br>
spend the thousands required to track you. But for most of us (again, <br>
we can hope), spying doesn't pay. The highly inefficient architecture of <br>
real space means we all enjoy a fairly robust amount of privacy. That <br>
privacy is guaranteed to us by friction. Not by law (there is no law pro-tecting <br>
"privacy" in public places), and in many places, not by norms <br>
(snooping and gossip are just fun), but instead, by the costs that fric-tion <br>
imposes on anyone who would want to spy. <br>
Enter the Internet, where the cost of tracking browsing in particu-lar <br>
has become quite tiny. If you're a customer at Amazon, then as you <br>
browse the pages, Amazon collects the data about what you've looked <br>
at. You know this because at the side of the page, there's a list of "re-cently <br>
viewed" pages. Now, because of the architecture of the Net and <br>
the function of cookies on the Net, it is easier to collect the data than <br>
not. The friction has disappeared, and hence any "privacy" protected by <br>
the friction disappears, too. <br>
Amazon, of course, is not the problem. But we might begin to <br>
worry about libraries. If you're one of those crazy lefties who thinks that <br>
people should have the "right" to browse in a library without the gov-ernment <br>
knowing which books you look at (I'm one of those lefties, <br>
too), then this change in the technology of monitoring might concern <br>
you. If it becomes simple to gather and sort who does what in electronic <br>
spaces, then the friction-induced privacy of yesterday disappears. <br>
It is this reality that explains the push of many to define "privacy" <br>
on the Internet. It is the recognition that technology can remove what <br>
friction before gave us that leads many to push for laws to do what fric-tion <br>
did. 1 And whether you're in favor of those laws or not, it is the pat-tern <br>
that is important here. We must take affirmative steps to secure a <br>

<br>

kind of freedom that was passively provided before. A change in tech-nology <br>
now forces those who believe in privacy to affirmatively act <br>
where, before, privacy was given by default. <br>
A similar story could be told about the birth of the free software <br>
movement. When computers with software were first made available <br>
commercially, the software&mdash;both the source code and the binaries&mdash;<br>
was free. You couldn't run a program written for a Data General ma-chine <br>
on an IBM machine, so Data General and IBM didn't care much <br>
about controlling their software. <br>
That was the world Richard Stallman was born into, and while he <br>
was a researcher at MIT, he grew to love the community that devel-oped <br>
when one was free to explore and tinker with the software that <br>
ran on machines. Being a smart sort himself, and a talented program-mer, <br>
Stallman grew to depend upon the freedom to add to or modify <br>
other people's work. <br>
In an academic setting, at least, that's not a terribly radical idea. In <br>
a math department, anyone would be free to tinker with a proof that <br>
someone offered. If you thought you had a better way to prove a theo-rem, <br>
you could take what someone else did and change it. In a classics <br>
department, if you believed a colleague's translation of a recently dis-covered <br>
text was flawed, you were free to improve it. Thus, to Stallman, <br>
it seemed obvious that you should be free to tinker with and improve <br>
the code that ran a machine. This, too, was knowledge. Why shouldn't <br>
it be open for criticism like anything else? <br>
No one answered that question. Instead, the architecture of revenue <br>
for computing changed. As it became possible to import programs <br>
from one system to another, it became economically attractive (at least <br>
in the view of some) to hide the code of your program. So, too, as com-panies <br>
started selling peripherals for mainframe systems. If I could just <br>
take your printer driver and copy it, then that would make it easier for <br>
me to sell a printer to the market than it was for you. <br>
Thus, the practice of proprietary code began to spread, and by the <br>
early 1980s, Stallman found himself surrounded by proprietary code. <br>

</p><p>
The world of free software had been erased by a change in the eco-nomics <br>
of computing. And as he believed, if he did nothing about it, <br>
then the freedom to change and share software would be fundamen-tally <br>
weakened. <br>
Therefore, in 1984, Stallman began a project to build a free operat-ing <br>
system, so that at least a strain of free software would survive. That <br>
was the birth of the GNU project, into which Linus Torvalds's "Linux" <br>
kernel was added to produce the GNU/ Linux operating system. <br>
Stallman's technique was to use copyright law to build a world of <br>
software that must be kept free. Software licensed under the Free Soft-ware <br>
Foundation's GPL cannot be modified and distributed unless the <br>
source code for that software is made available as well. Thus, anyone <br>
building upon GPL'd software would have to make their buildings free <br>
as well. This would assure, Stallman believed, that an ecology of code <br>
would develop that remained free for others to build upon. His funda-mental <br>
goal was freedom; innovative creative code was a byproduct. <br>
Stallman was thus doing for software what privacy advocates now <br>
do for privacy. He was seeking a way to rebuild a kind of freedom that <br>
was taken for granted before. Through the affirmative use of licenses <br>
that bind copyrighted code, Stallman was affirmatively reclaiming a <br>
space where free software would survive. He was actively protecting <br>
what before had been passively guaranteed. <br>
Finally, consider a very recent example that more directly resonates <br>
with the story of this book. This is the shift in the way academic and <br>
scientific journals are produced. <br>
As digital technologies develop, it is becoming obvious to many <br>
that printing thousands of copies of journals every month and sending <br>
them to libraries is perhaps not the most efficient way to distribute <br>
knowledge. Instead, journals are increasingly becoming electronic, and <br>
libraries and their users are given access to these electronic journals <br>
through password-protected sites. Something similar to this has been <br>
happening in law for almost thirty years: Lexis and Westlaw have had <br>
electronic versions of case reports available to subscribers to their ser-280 <br>

<br>

vice. Although a Supreme Court opinion is not copyrighted, and any-one <br>
is free to go to a library and read it, Lexis and Westlaw are also free <br>
to charge users for the privilege of gaining access to that Supreme <br>
Court opinion through their respective services. <br>
There's nothing wrong in general with this, and indeed, the ability <br>
to charge for access to even public domain materials is a good incentive <br>
for people to develop new and innovative ways to spread knowledge. <br>
The law has agreed, which is why Lexis and Westlaw have been al-lowed <br>
to flourish. And if there's nothing wrong with selling the public <br>
domain, then there could be nothing wrong, in principle, with selling <br>
access to material that is not in the public domain. <br>
But what if the only way to get access to social and scientific data <br>
was through proprietary services? What if no one had the ability to <br>
browse this data except by paying for a subscription? <br>
As many are beginning to notice, this is increasingly the reality with <br>
scientific journals. When these journals were distributed in paper form, <br>
libraries could make the journals available to anyone who had access to <br>
the library. Thus, patients with cancer could become cancer experts be-cause <br>
the library gave them access. Or patients trying to understand <br>
the risks of a certain treatment could research those risks by reading all <br>
available articles about that treatment. This freedom was therefore a <br>
function of the institution of libraries (norms) and the technology of <br>
paper journals (architecture)&mdash;namely, that it was very hard to control <br>
access to a paper journal. <br>
As journals become electronic, however, the publishers are demand-ing <br>
that libraries not give the general public access to the journals. This <br>
means that the freedoms provided by print journals in public libraries <br>
begin to disappear. Thus, as with privacy and with software, a changing <br>
technology and market shrink a freedom taken for granted before. <br>
This shrinking freedom has led many to take affirmative steps to <br>
restore the freedom that has been lost. The Public Library of Science <br>
(PLoS), for example, is a nonprofit corporation dedicated to making <br>
scientific research available to anyone with a Web connection. Authors <br>

of scientific work submit that work to the Public Library of Science. <br>
That work is then subject to peer review. If accepted, the work is then <br>
deposited in a public, electronic archive and made permanently avail-able <br>
for free. PLoS also sells a print version of its work, but the copy-right <br>
for the print journal does not inhibit the right of anyone to <br>
redistribute the work for free. <br>
This is one of many such efforts to restore a freedom taken for <br>
granted before, but now threatened by changing technology and mar-kets. <br>
There's no doubt that this alternative competes with the tradi-tional <br>
publishers and their efforts to make money from the exclusive <br>
distribution of content. But competition in our tradition is presump-tively <br>
a good&mdash;especially when it helps spread knowledge and science. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>Rebuilding Free Culture: One Idea <br>
</tt>The same strategy could be applied to culture, as a response to the in-creasing <br>
control effected through law and technology. <br>
Enter the Creative Commons. The Creative Commons is a non-profit <br>
corporation established in Massachusetts, but with its home at <br>
Stanford University. Its aim is to build a layer of <i>reasonable </i>copyright <br>
on top of the extremes that now reign. It does this by making it easy for <br>
people to build upon other people's work, by making it simple for cre-ators <br>
to express the freedom for others to take and build upon their <br>
work. Simple tags, tied to human-readable descriptions, tied to bullet-proof <br>
licenses, make this possible. <br>
<i>Simple&mdash;</i>which means without a middleman, or without a lawyer. <br>
By developing a free set of licenses that people can attach to their <br>
content, Creative Commons aims to mark a range of content that <br>
can easily, and reliably, be built upon. These tags are then linked to <br>
machine-readable versions of the license that enable computers auto-matically <br>
to identify content that can easily be shared. These three ex-282 <br>

<br>

pressions together&mdash;a legal license, a human-readable description, and <br>
machine-readable tags&mdash;constitute a Creative Commons license. A <br>
Creative Commons license constitutes a grant of freedom to anyone <br>
who accesses the license, and more importantly, an expression of the <br>
ideal that the person associated with the license believes in something <br>
different than the "All" or "No" extremes. Content is marked with the <br>
CC mark, which does not mean that copyright is waived, but that cer-tain <br>
freedoms are given. <br>
These freedoms are beyond the freedoms promised by fair use. Their <br>
precise contours depend upon the choices the creator makes. The cre-ator <br>
can choose a license that permits any use, so long as attribution is <br>
given. She can choose a license that permits only noncommercial use. <br>
She can choose a license that permits any use so long as the same free-doms <br>
are given to other uses (" share and share alike"). Or any use so <br>
long as no derivative use is made. Or any use at all within developing <br>
nations. Or any sampling use, so long as full copies are not made. Or <br>
lastly, any educational use. <br>
These choices thus establish a range of freedoms beyond the default <br>
of copyright law. They also enable freedoms that go beyond traditional <br>
fair use. And most importantly, they express these freedoms in a way <br>
that subsequent users can use and rely upon without the need to hire a <br>
lawyer. Creative Commons thus aims to build a layer of content, gov-erned <br>
by a layer of reasonable copyright law, that others can build <br>
upon. Voluntary choice of individuals and creators will make this con-tent <br>
available. And that content will in turn enable us to rebuild a pub-lic <br>
domain. <br>
This is just one project among many within the Creative Com-mons. <br>
And of course, Creative Commons is not the only organization <br>
pursuing such freedoms. But the point that distinguishes the Creative <br>
Commons from many is that we are not interested only in talking <br>
about a public domain or in getting legislators to help build a public <br>
domain. Our aim is to build a movement of consumers and producers <br>

of content (" content conducers," as attorney Mia Garlick calls them) <br>
who help build the public domain and, by their work, demonstrate the <br>
importance of the public domain to other creativity. <br>
The aim is not to fight the "All Rights Reserved" sorts. The aim is <br>
to complement them. The problems that the law creates for us as a cul-ture <br>
are produced by insane and unintended consequences of laws <br>
written centuries ago, applied to a technology that only Jefferson could <br>
have imagined. The rules may well have made sense against a back-ground <br>
of technologies from centuries ago, but they do not make sense <br>
against the background of digital technologies. New rules&mdash;with dif-ferent <br>
freedoms, expressed in ways so that humans without lawyers can <br>
use them&mdash;are needed. Creative Commons gives people a way effec-tively <br>
to begin to build those rules. <br>
Why would creators participate in giving up total control? Some <br>
participate to better spread their content. Cory Doctorow, for example, <br>
is a science fiction author. His first novel, <i>Down and Out in the Magic <br>
Kingdom, </i>was released on-line and for free, under a Creative Com-mons <br>
license, on the same day that it went on sale in bookstores. <br>
Why would a publisher ever agree to this? I suspect his publisher <br>
reasoned like this: There are two groups of people out there: (1) those <br>
who will buy Cory's book whether or not it's on the Internet, and (2) <br>
those who may never hear of Cory's book, if it isn't made available for <br>
free on the Internet. Some part of (1) will download Cory's book in-stead <br>
of buying it. Call them bad-( 1) s. Some part of (2) will download <br>
Cory's book, like it, and then decide to buy it. Call them (2)-goods. <br>
If there are more (2)-goods than bad-( 1) s, the strategy of releasing <br>
Cory's book free on-line will probably <i>increase </i>sales of Cory's book. <br>
Indeed, the experience of his publisher clearly supports that con-clusion. <br>
The book's first printing was exhausted months before the <br>
publisher had expected. This first novel of a science fiction author was <br>
a total success. <br>
The idea that free content might increase the value of nonfree con-tent <br>
was confirmed by the experience of another author. Peter Wayner, <br>

who wrote a book about the free software movement titled <i>Free for All, <br>
</i>made an electronic version of his book free on-line under a Creative <br>
Commons license after the book went out of print. He then monitored <br>
used book store prices for the book. As predicted, as the number of <br>
downloads increased, the used book price for his book increased, as <br>
well. <br>
These are examples of using the Commons to better spread propri-etary <br>
content. I believe that is a wonderful and common use of the <br>
Commons. There are others who use Creative Commons licenses for <br>
other reasons. Many who use the "sampling license" do so because any-thing <br>
else would be hypocritical. The sampling license says that others <br>
are free, for commercial or noncommercial purposes, to sample content <br>
from the licensed work; they are just not free to make full copies of the <br>
licensed work available to others. This is consistent with their own <br>
art&mdash;they, too, sample from others. Because the <i>legal </i>costs of sampling <br>
are so high (Walter Leaphart, manager of the rap group Public Enemy, <br>
which was born sampling the music of others, has stated that he does <br>
not "allow" Public Enemy to sample anymore, because the legal costs <br>
are so high 2 ), these artists release into the creative environment content <br>
that others can build upon, so that their form of creativity might grow. <br>
Finally, there are many who mark their content with a Creative <br>
Commons license just because they want to express to others the im-portance <br>
of balance in this debate. If you just go along with the system <br>
as it is, you are effectively saying you believe in the "All Rights Reserved" <br>
model. Good for you, but many do not. Many believe that however ap-propriate <br>
that rule is for Hollywood and freaks, it is not an appropriate <br>
description of how most creators view the rights associated with their <br>
content. The Creative Commons license expresses this notion of "Some <br>
Rights Reserved," and gives many the chance to say it to others. <br>
In the first six months of the Creative Commons experiment, over <br>
1 million objects were licensed with these free-culture licenses. The next <br>
step is partnerships with middleware content providers to help them <br>
build into their technologies simple ways for users to mark their content <br>

with Creative Commons freedoms. Then the next step is to watch and <br>
celebrate creators who build content based upon content set free. <br>
These are first steps to rebuilding a public domain. They are not <br>
mere arguments; they are action. Building a public domain is the first <br>
step to showing people how important that domain is to creativity and <br>
innovation. Creative Commons relies upon voluntary steps to achieve <br>
this rebuilding. They will lead to a world in which more than voluntary <br>
steps are possible. <br>
Creative Commons is just one example of voluntary efforts by indi-viduals <br>
and creators to change the mix of rights that now govern the <br>
creative field. The project does not compete with copyright; it comple-ments <br>
it. Its aim is not to defeat the rights of authors, but to make it <br>
easier for authors and creators to exercise their rights more flexibly and <br>
cheaply. That difference, we believe, will enable creativity to spread <br>
more easily. <br>

<tt>THEM, SOON <br>
We will </tt>not reclaim a free culture by individual action alone. It will <br>
also take important reforms of laws. We have a long way to go before <br>
the politicians will listen to these ideas and implement these reforms. <br>
But that also means that we have time to build awareness around the <br>
changes that we need. <br>
In this chapter, I outline five kinds of changes: four that are general, <br>
and one that's specific to the most heated battle of the day, music. Each <br>
is a step, not an end. But any of these steps would carry us a long way <br>
to our end. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>1. More Formalities <br>
</tt>If you buy a house, you have to record the sale in a deed. If you buy land <br>
upon which to build a house, you have to record the purchase in a deed. <br>
If you buy a car, you get a bill of sale and register the car. If you buy an <br>
airplane ticket, it has your name on it. <br>

<a href="#page293">293</a>
<strong><a name="page294"> Page 294</a></strong>
<a href="#page295">295</a>
<br>
</p><p>
These are all formalities associated with property. They are require-ments <br>
that we all must bear if we want our property to be protected. <br>
In contrast, under current copyright law, you automatically get a <br>
copyright, regardless of whether you comply with any formality. You <br>
don't have to register. You don't even have to mark your content. The <br>
default is control, and "formalities" are banished. <br>
Why? <br>
As I suggested in chapter 10, the motivation to abolish formalities <br>
was a good one. In the world before digital technologies, formalities <br>
imposed a burden on copyright holders without much benefit. Thus, it <br>
was progress when the law relaxed the formal requirements that a <br>
copyright owner must bear to protect and secure his work. Those for-malities <br>
were getting in the way. <br>
But the Internet changes all this. Formalities today need not be a <br>
burden. Rather, the world without formalities is the world that bur-dens <br>
creativity. Today, there is no simple way to know who owns what, <br>
or with whom one must deal in order to use or build upon the cre-ative <br>
work of others. There are no records, there is no system to trace&mdash;<br>
there is no simple way to know how to get permission. Yet given the <br>
massive increase in the scope of copyright's rule, getting permission is <br>
a necessary step for any work that builds upon our past. And thus, the <br>
<i>lack </i>of formalities forces many into silence where they otherwise could <br>
speak. <br>
The law should therefore change this requirement 1 &ndash;but it should <br>
not change it by going back to the old, broken system. We should re-quire <br>
formalities, but we should establish a system that will create the <br>
incentives to minimize the burden of these formalities. <br>
The important formalities are three: marking copyrighted work, reg-istering <br>
copyrights, and renewing the claim to copyright. Traditionally, <br>
the first of these three was something the copyright owner did; the sec-ond <br>
two were something the government did. But a revised system of <br>
formalities would banish the government from the process, except for <br>
the sole purpose of approving standards developed by others. <br>

<br>

<tt>REGISTRATION AND RENEWAL <br>
</tt>Under the old system, a copyright owner had to file a registration with <br>
the Copyright Office to register or renew a copyright. When filing that <br>
registration, the copyright owner paid a fee. As with most government <br>
agencies, the Copyright Office had little incentive to minimize the <br>
burden of registration; it also had little incentive to minimize the fee. <br>
And as the Copyright Office is not a main target of government policy-making, <br>
the office has historically been terribly underfunded. Thus, <br>
when people who know something about the process hear this idea <br>
about formalities, their first reaction is panic&mdash;nothing could be worse <br>
than forcing people to deal with the mess that is the Copyright Office. <br>
Yet it is always astonishing to me that we, who come from a tradi-tion <br>
of extraordinary innovation in governmental design, can no longer <br>
think innovatively about how governmental functions can be designed. <br>
Just because there is a public purpose to a government role, it doesn't <br>
follow that the government must actually administer the role. Instead, <br>
we should be creating incentives for private parties to serve the public, <br>
subject to standards that the government sets. <br>
In the context of registration, one obvious model is the Internet. <br>
There are at least 32 million Web sites registered around the world. <br>
Domain name owners for these Web sites have to pay a fee to keep their <br>
registration alive. In the main top-level domains (. com, .org, .net), <br>
there is a central registry. The actual registrations are, however, per-formed <br>
by many competing registrars. That competition drives the cost <br>
of registering down, and more importantly, it drives the ease with which <br>
registration occurs up. <br>
We should adopt a similar model for the registration and renewal of <br>
copyrights. The Copyright Office may well serve as the central registry, <br>
but it should not be in the registrar business. Instead, it should estab-lish <br>
a database, and a set of standards for registrars. It should approve <br>
registrars that meet its standards. Those registrars would then compete <br>
with one another to deliver the cheapest and simplest systems for reg-istering <br>
and renewing copyrights. That competition would substan-AFTERWORD <br>

</p><p>
tially lower the burden of this formality&mdash;while producing a database <br>
of registrations that would facilitate the licensing of content. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>MARKING <br>
</tt>It used to be that the failure to include a copyright notice on a creative <br>
work meant that the copyright was forfeited. That was a harsh punish-ment <br>
for failing to comply with a regulatory rule&mdash;akin to imposing <br>
the death penalty for a parking ticket in the world of creative rights. <br>
Here again, there is no reason that a marking requirement needs to be <br>
enforced in this way. And more importantly, there is no reason a mark-ing <br>
requirement needs to be enforced uniformly across all media. <br>
The aim of marking is to signal to the public that this work is copy-righted <br>
and that the author wants to enforce his rights. The mark also <br>
makes it easy to locate a copyright owner to secure permission to use <br>
the work. <br>
One of the problems the copyright system confronted early on was <br>
that different copyrighted works had to be differently marked. It wasn't <br>
clear how or where a statue was to be marked, or a record, or a film. A <br>
new marking requirement could solve these problems by recognizing <br>
the differences in media, and by allowing the system of marking to <br>
evolve as technologies enable it to. The system could enable a special <br>
signal from the failure to mark&mdash;not the loss of the copyright, but the <br>
loss of the right to punish someone for failing to get permission first. <br>
Let's start with the last point. If a copyright owner allows his work <br>
to be published without a copyright notice, the consequence of that <br>
failure need not be that the copyright is lost. The consequence could <br>
instead be that anyone has the right to use this work, until the copy-right <br>
owner complains and demonstrates that it is his work and he <br>
doesn't give permission. 2 The meaning of an unmarked work would <br>
therefore be "use unless someone complains." If someone does com-plain, <br>
then the obligation would be to stop using the work in any new <br>

<br>

work from then on though no penalty would attach for existing uses. <br>
This would create a strong incentive for copyright owners to mark <br>
their work. <br>
That in turn raises the question about how work should best be <br>
marked. Here again, the system needs to adjust as the technologies <br>
evolve. The best way to ensure that the system evolves is to limit the <br>
Copyright Office's role to that of approving standards for marking <br>
content that have been crafted elsewhere. <br>
For example, if a recording industry association devises a method <br>
for marking CDs, it would propose that to the Copyright Office. The <br>
Copyright Office would hold a hearing, at which other proposals could <br>
be made. The Copyright Office would then select the proposal that it <br>
judged preferable, and it would base that choice <i>solely </i>upon the consid-eration <br>
of which method could best be integrated into the registration <br>
and renewal system. We would not count on the government to inno-vate; <br>
but we would count on the government to keep the product of in-novation <br>
in line with its other important functions. <br>
Finally, marking content clearly would simplify registration re-quirements. <br>
If photographs were marked by author and year, there <br>
would be little reason not to allow a photographer to reregister, for ex-ample, <br>
all photographs taken in a particular year in one quick step. The <br>
aim of the formality is not to burden the creator; the system itself <br>
should be kept as simple as possible. <br>
The objective of formalities is to make things clear. The existing <br>
system does nothing to make things clear. Indeed, it seems designed to <br>
make things unclear. <br>
If formalities such as registration were reinstated, one of the most <br>
difficult aspects of relying upon the public domain would be removed. <br>
It would be simple to identify what content is presumptively free; it <br>
would be simple to identify who controls the rights for a particular <br>
kind of content; it would be simple to assert those rights, and to renew <br>
that assertion at the appropriate time. <br>

<tt>2. Shorter Terms <br>
</tt>The term of copyright has gone from fourteen years to ninety-five <br>
years for corporate authors, and life of the author plus seventy years for <br>
natural authors. <br>
In <i>The Future of Ideas, </i>I proposed a seventy-five-year term, granted <br>
in five-year increments with a requirement of renewal every five years. <br>
That seemed radical enough at the time. But after we lost <i>Eldred </i>v. <br>
<i>Ashcroft, </i>the proposals became even more radical. <i>The Economist </i>en-dorsed <br>
a proposal for a fourteen-year copyright term. 3 Others have <br>
proposed tying the term to the term for patents. <br>
I agree with those who believe that we need a radical change in copy-right's <br>
term. But whether fourteen years or seventy-five, there are four <br>
principles that are important to keep in mind about copyright terms. <br>
</p><p>
(1) <i>Keep it short: </i>The term should be as long as necessary to <br>
give incentives to create, but no longer. If it were tied to very <br>
strong protections for authors (so authors were able to reclaim <br>
rights from publishers), rights to the same work (not deriva-tive <br>
works) might be extended further. The key is not to tie the <br>
work up with legal regulations when it no longer benefits an <br>
author. <br>
</p><p>
(2) <i>Keep it simple: </i>The line between the public domain and <br>
protected content must be kept clear. Lawyers like the fuzzi-ness <br>
of "fair use," and the distinction between "ideas" and "ex-pression." <br>
That kind of law gives them lots of work. But our <br>
framers had a simpler idea in mind: protected versus unpro-tected. <br>
The value of short terms is that there is little need to <br>
build exceptions into copyright when the term itself is kept <br>
short. A clear and active "lawyer-free zone" makes the com-plexities <br>
of "fair use" and "idea/ expression" less necessary to <br>
navigate. <br>

<strong><a name="page299"> Page 299</a></strong>
<a href="#page300">300</a>
<br>

(3) <i>Keep it alive: </i>Copyright should have to be renewed. Espe-cially <br>
if the maximum term is long, the copyright owner <br>
should be required to signal periodically that he wants the <br>
protection continued. This need not be an onerous burden, <br>
but there is no reason this monopoly protection has to be <br>
granted for free. On average, it takes ninety minutes for a vet-eran <br>
to apply for a pension. 4 If we make veterans suffer that <br>
burden, I don't see why we couldn't require authors to spend <br>
ten minutes every fifty years to file a single form. <br>
</p><p>
(4) <i>Keep it prospective: </i>Whatever the term of copyright should <br>
be, the clearest lesson that economists teach is that a term <br>
once given should not be extended. It might have been a mis-take <br>
in 1923 for the law to offer authors only a fifty-six-year <br>
term. I don't think so, but it's possible. If it was a mistake, then <br>
the consequence was that we got fewer authors to create in <br>
1923 than we otherwise would have. But we can't correct that <br>
mistake today by increasing the term. No matter what we do <br>
today, we will not increase the number of authors who wrote <br>
in 1923. Of course, we can increase the reward that those who <br>
write now get (or alternatively, increase the copyright burden <br>
that smothers many works that are today invisible). But in-creasing <br>
their reward will not increase their creativity in 1923. <br>
What's not done is not done, and there's nothing we can do <br>
about that now. <br>
</p><p>
These changes together should produce an <i>average </i>copyright term <br>
that is much shorter than the current term. Until 1976, the average <br>
term was just 32.2 years. We should be aiming for the same. <br>
No doubt the extremists will call these ideas "radical." (After all, I <br>
call them "extremists.") But again, the term I recommended was longer <br>
than the term under Richard Nixon. How "radical" can it be to ask for <br>
a more generous copyright law than Richard Nixon presided over? <br>

<tt>3. Free Use Vs. Fair Use <br>
</tt>As I observed at the beginning of this book, property law originally <br>
granted property owners the right to control their property from the <br>
ground to the heavens. The airplane came along. The scope of property <br>
rights quickly changed. There was no fuss, no constitutional challenge. <br>
It made no sense anymore to grant that much control, given the emer-gence <br>
of that new technology. <br>
Our Constitution gives Congress the power to give authors "exclu-sive <br>
right" to "their writings." Congress has given authors an exclusive <br>
right to "their writings" plus any derivative writings (made by others) that <br>
are sufficiently close to the author's original work. Thus, if I write a book, <br>
and you base a movie on that book, I have the power to deny you the <br>
right to release that movie, even though that movie is not "my writing." <br>
Congress granted the beginnings of this right in 1870, when it ex-panded <br>
the exclusive right of copyright to include a right to control <br>
translations and dramatizations of a work. 5 The courts have expanded <br>
it slowly through judicial interpretation ever since. This expansion has <br>
been commented upon by one of the law's greatest judges, Judge Ben-jamin <br>
Kaplan. <br>
</p><p>
So inured have we become to the extension of the monopoly to a <br>
large range of so-called derivative works, that we no longer sense <br>
the oddity of accepting such an enlargement of copyright while <br>
yet intoning the abracadabra of idea and expression. 6 <br>
</p><p>
I think it's time to recognize that there are airplanes in this field and <br>
the expansiveness of these rights of derivative use no longer make <br>
sense. More precisely, they don't make sense for the period of time that <br>
a copyright runs. And they don't make sense as an amorphous grant. <br>
Consider each limitation in turn. <br>
<i>Term: </i>If Congress wants to grant a derivative right, then that right <br>
should be for a much shorter term. It makes sense to protect John <br>

Grisham's right to sell the movie rights to his latest novel (or at least <br>
I'm willing to assume it does); but it does not make sense for that right <br>
to run for the same term as the underlying copyright. The derivative <br>
right could be important in inducing creativity; it is not important long <br>
after the creative work is done. <br>
<i>Scope: </i>Likewise should the scope of derivative rights be narrowed. <br>
Again, there are some cases in which derivative rights are important. <br>
Those should be specified. But the law should draw clear lines around <br>
regulated and unregulated uses of copyrighted material. When all <br>
"reuse" of creative material was within the control of businesses, per-haps <br>
it made sense to require lawyers to negotiate the lines. It no longer <br>
makes sense for lawyers to negotiate the lines. Think about all the cre-ative <br>
possibilities that digital technologies enable; now imagine pour-ing <br>
molasses into the machines. That's what this general requirement <br>
of permission does to the creative process. Smothers it. <br>
This was the point that Alben made when describing the making of <br>
the Clint Eastwood CD. While it makes sense to require negotiation <br>
for foreseeable derivative rights&mdash;turning a book into a movie, or a <br>
poem into a musical score&mdash;it doesn't make sense to require negotia-tion <br>
for the unforeseeable. Here, a statutory right would make much <br>
more sense. <br>
In each of these cases, the law should mark the uses that are pro-tected, <br>
and the presumption should be that other uses are not pro-tected. <br>
This is the reverse of the recommendation of my colleague Paul <br>
Goldstein. 7 His view is that the law should be written so that expanded <br>
protections follow expanded uses. <br>
Goldstein's analysis would make perfect sense if the cost of the le-gal <br>
system were small. But as we are currently seeing in the context of <br>
the Internet, the uncertainty about the scope of protection, and the in-centives <br>
to protect existing architectures of revenue, combined with a <br>
strong copyright, weaken the process of innovation. <br>
The law could remedy this problem either by removing protection <br>
beyond the part explicitly drawn or by granting reuse rights upon cer-AFTERWORD <br>

tain statutory conditions. Either way, the effect would be to free a great <br>
deal of culture to others to cultivate. And under a statutory rights <br>
regime, that reuse would earn artists more income. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>4. Liberate the Music&mdash;Again <br>
</tt>The battle that got this whole war going was about music, so it wouldn't <br>
be fair to end this book without addressing the issue that is, to most <br>
people, most pressing&mdash;music. There is no other policy issue that bet-ter <br>
teaches the lessons of this book than the battles around the sharing <br>
of music. <br>
The appeal of file-sharing music was the crack cocaine of the Inter-net's <br>
growth. It drove demand for access to the Internet more power-fully <br>
than any other single application. It was the Internet's killer <br>
app&mdash;possibly in two senses of that word. It no doubt was the applica-tion <br>
that drove demand for bandwidth. It may well be the application <br>
that drives demand for regulations that in the end kill innovation on <br>
the network. <br>
The aim of copyright, with respect to content in general and music <br>
in particular, is to create the incentives for music to be composed, per-formed, <br>
and, most importantly, spread. The law does this by giving <br>
an exclusive right to a composer to control public performances of his <br>
work, and to a performing artist to control copies of her performance. <br>
File-sharing networks complicate this model by enabling the <br>
spread of content for which the performer has not been paid. But of <br>
course, that's not all the file-sharing networks do. As I described in <br>
chapter 5, they enable four different kinds of sharing: <br>
</p><p>
A. There are some who are using sharing networks as substitutes <br>
for purchasing CDs. <br>
B. There are also some who are using sharing networks to sample, <br>
on the way to purchasing CDs. <br>

<br>

C. There are many who are using file-sharing networks to get ac-cess <br>
to content that is no longer sold but is still under copyright <br>
or that would have been too cumbersome to buy off the Net. <br>
D. There are many who are using file-sharing networks to get ac-cess <br>
to content that is not copyrighted or to get access that the <br>
copyright owner plainly endorses. <br>
</p><p>
Any reform of the law needs to keep these different uses in focus. It <br>
must avoid burdening type D even if it aims to eliminate type A. The <br>
eagerness with which the law aims to eliminate type A, moreover, <br>
should depend upon the magnitude of type B. As with VCRs, if the net <br>
effect of sharing is actually not very harmful, the need for regulation is <br>
significantly weakened. <br>
As I said in chapter 5, the actual harm caused by sharing is contro-versial. <br>
For the purposes of this chapter, however, I assume the harm is <br>
real. I assume, in other words, that type A sharing is significantly <br>
greater than type B, and is the dominant use of sharing networks. <br>
Nonetheless, there is a crucial fact about the current technological <br>
context that we must keep in mind if we are to understand how the law <br>
should respond. <br>
Today, file sharing is addictive. In ten years, it won't be. It is addictive <br>
today because it is the easiest way to gain access to a broad range of con-tent. <br>
It won't be the easiest way to get access to a broad range of content <br>
in ten years. Today, access to the Internet is cumbersome and slow&mdash;we <br>
in the United States are lucky to have broadband service at 1.5 MBs, and <br>
very rarely do we get service at that speed both up and down. Although <br>
wireless access is growing, most of us still get access across wires. Most <br>
only gain access through a machine with a keyboard. The idea of the al-ways <br>
on, always connected Internet is mainly just an idea. <br>
But it will become a reality, and that means the way we get access to <br>
the Internet today is a technology in transition. Policy makers should <br>
not make policy on the basis of technology in transition. They should <br>

which every machine with electricity is essentially on the Net; where <br>
everywhere you are&mdash;except maybe the desert or the Rockies&mdash;you can <br>
instantaneously be connected to the Internet. Imagine the Internet as <br>
ubiquitous as the best cell-phone service, where with the flip of a de-vice, <br>
you are connected. <br>
In that world, it will be extremely easy to connect to services that <br>
give you access to content on the fly&mdash;such as Internet radio, content <br>
that is streamed to the user when the user demands. Here, then, is the <br>
critical point: When it is <i>extremely </i>easy to connect to services that give <br>
access to content, it will be <i>easier </i>to connect to services that give you <br>
access to content than it will be to download and store content <i>on the <br>
many devices you will have for playing content. </i>It will be easier, in other <br>
words, to subscribe than it will be to be a database manager, as every-one <br>
in the download-sharing world of Napster-like technologies es-sentially <br>
is. Content services will compete with content sharing, even if <br>
the services charge money for the content they give access to. Already <br>
cell-phone services in Japan offer music (for a fee) streamed over cell <br>
phones (enhanced with plugs for headphones). The Japanese are pay-ing <br>
for this content even though "free" content is available in the form <br>
of MP3s across the Web. 8 <br>
This point about the future is meant to suggest a perspective on the <br>
present: It is emphatically temporary. The "problem" with file shar-ing&mdash;<br>
to the extent there is a real problem&mdash;is a problem that will in-creasingly <br>
disappear as it becomes easier to connect to the Internet. <br>
And thus it is an extraordinary mistake for policy makers today to be <br>
"solving" this problem in light of a technology that will be gone to-morrow. <br>
The question should not be how to regulate the Internet to <br>
eliminate file sharing (the Net will evolve that problem away). The <br>
question instead should be how to assure that artists get paid, during <br>

this transition between twentieth-century models for doing business <br>
and twenty-first-century technologies. <br>
The answer begins with recognizing that there are different "prob-lems" <br>
here to solve. Let's start with type D content&mdash;uncopyrighted <br>
content or copyrighted content that the artist wants shared. The "prob-lem" <br>
with this content is to make sure that the technology that would <br>
enable this kind of sharing is not rendered illegal. You can think of it <br>
this way: Pay phones are used to deliver ransom demands, no doubt. <br>
But there are many who need to use pay phones who have nothing to <br>
do with ransoms. It would be wrong to ban pay phones in order to <br>
eliminate kidnapping. <br>
Type C content raises a different "problem." This is content that was, <br>
at one time, published and is no longer available. It may be unavailable <br>
because the artist is no longer valuable enough for the record label he <br>
signed with to carry his work. Or it may be unavailable because the work <br>
is forgotten. Either way, the aim of the law should be to facilitate the ac-cess <br>
to this content, ideally in a way that returns something to the artist. <br>
Again, the model here is the used book store. Once a book goes out <br>
of print, it may still be available in libraries and used book stores. But <br>
libraries and used book stores don't pay the copyright owner when <br>
someone reads or buys an out-of-print book. That makes total sense, of <br>
course, since any other system would be so burdensome as to eliminate <br>
the possibility of used book stores' existing. But from the author's per-spective, <br>
this "sharing" of his content without his being compensated is <br>
less than ideal. <br>
The model of used book stores suggests that the law could simply <br>
deem out-of-print music fair game. If the publisher does not make <br>
copies of the music available for sale, then commercial and noncom-mercial <br>
providers would be free, under this rule, to "share" that content, <br>
even though the sharing involved making a copy. The copy here would <br>
be incidental to the trade; in a context where commercial publishing <br>
has ended, trading music should be as free as trading books. <br>

<a href="#page307">307</a>
<br>
</p><p>
Alternatively, the law could create a statutory license that would en-sure <br>
that artists get something from the trade of their work. For exam-ple, <br>
if the law set a low statutory rate for the commercial sharing of <br>
content that was not offered for sale by a commercial publisher, and if <br>
that rate were automatically transferred to a trust for the benefit of the <br>
artist, then businesses could develop around the idea of trading this <br>
content, and artists would benefit from this trade. <br>
This system would also create an incentive for publishers to keep <br>
works available commercially. Works that are available commercially <br>
would not be subject to this license. Thus, publishers could protect <br>
the right to charge whatever they want for content if they kept the <br>
work commercially available. But if they don't keep it available, and in-stead, <br>
the computer hard disks of fans around the world keep it alive, <br>
then any royalty owed for such copying should be much less than the <br>
amount owed a commercial publisher. <br>
The hard case is content of types A and B, and again, this case is <br>
hard only because the extent of the problem will change over time, as <br>
the technologies for gaining access to content change. The law's solu-tion <br>
should be as flexible as the problem is, understanding that we are <br>
in the middle of a radical transformation in the technology for deliver-ing <br>
and accessing content. <br>
So here's a solution that will at first seem very strange to both sides <br>
in this war, but which upon reflection, I suggest, should make some sense. <br>
Stripped of the rhetoric about the sanctity of property, the basic <br>
claim of the content industry is this: A new technology (the Internet) <br>
has harmed a set of rights that secure copyright. If those rights are to <br>
be protected, then the content industry should be compensated for that <br>
harm. Just as the technology of tobacco harmed the health of millions <br>
of Americans, or the technology of asbestos caused grave illness to <br>
thousands of miners, so, too, has the technology of digital networks <br>
harmed the interests of the content industry. <br>
I love the Internet, and so I don't like likening it to tobacco or as-300 <br>

bestos. But the analogy is a fair one from the perspective of the law. <br>
And it suggests a fair response: Rather than seeking to destroy the In-ternet, <br>
or the p2p technologies that are currently harming content <br>
providers on the Internet, we should find a relatively simple way to <br>
compensate those who are harmed. <br>
The idea would be a modification of a proposal that has been <br>
floated by Harvard law professor William Fisher. 9 Fisher suggests a <br>
very clever way around the current impasse of the Internet. Under his <br>
plan, all content capable of digital transmission would (1) be marked <br>
with a digital watermark (don't worry about how easy it is to evade <br>
these marks; as you'll see, there's no incentive to evade them). Once the <br>
content is marked, then entrepreneurs would develop (2) systems to <br>
monitor how many items of each content were distributed. On the ba-sis <br>
of those numbers, then (3) artists would be compensated. The com-pensation <br>
would be paid for by (4) an appropriate tax. <br>
Fisher's proposal is careful and comprehensive. It raises a million <br>
questions, most of which he answers well in his upcoming book, <br>
<i>Promises to Keep. </i>The modification that I would make is relatively sim-ple: <br>
Fisher imagines his proposal replacing the existing copyright sys-tem. <br>
I imagine it complementing the existing system. The aim of the <br>
proposal would be to facilitate compensation to the extent that harm <br>
could be shown. This compensation would be temporary, aimed at fa-cilitating <br>
a transition between regimes. And it would require renewal <br>
after a period of years. If it continues to make sense to facilitate free ex-change <br>
of content, supported through a taxation system, then it can be <br>
continued. If this form of protection is no longer necessary, then the <br>
system could lapse into the old system of controlling access. <br>
Fisher would balk at the idea of allowing the system to lapse. His <br>
aim is not just to ensure that artists are paid, but also to ensure that the <br>
system supports the widest range of "semiotic democracy" possible. But <br>
the aims of semiotic democracy would be satisfied if the other changes <br>
I described were accomplished&mdash;in particular, the limits on derivative <br>

<br>
</p><p>
uses. A system that simply charges for access would not greatly burden <br>
semiotic democracy if there were few limitations on what one was al-lowed <br>
to do with the content itself. <br>
No doubt it would be difficult to calculate the proper measure of <br>
"harm" to an industry. But the difficulty of making that calculation <br>
would be outweighed by the benefit of facilitating innovation. This <br>
background system to compensate would also not need to interfere <br>
with innovative proposals such as Apple's MusicStore. As experts pre-dicted <br>
when Apple launched the MusicStore, it could beat "free" by be-ing <br>
easier than free is. This has proven correct: Apple has sold millions <br>
of songs at even the very high price of 99 cents a song. (At 99 cents, the <br>
cost is the equivalent of a per-song CD price, though the labels have <br>
none of the costs of a CD to pay.) Apple's move was countered by Real <br>
Networks, offering music at just 79 cents a song. And no doubt there <br>
will be a great deal of competition to offer and sell music on-line. <br>
This competition has already occurred against the background of <br>
"free" music from p2p systems. As the sellers of cable television have <br>
known for thirty years, and the sellers of bottled water for much more <br>
than that, there is nothing impossible at all about "competing with <br>
free." Indeed, if anything, the competition spurs the competitors to of-fer <br>
new and better products. This is precisely what the competitive <br>
market was to be about. Thus in Singapore, though piracy is rampant, <br>
movie theaters are often luxurious&mdash;with "first class" seats, and meals <br>
served while you watch a movie&mdash;as they struggle and succeed in find-ing <br>
ways to compete with "free." <br>
This regime of competition, with a backstop to assure that artists <br>
don't lose, would facilitate a great deal of innovation in the delivery of <br>
content. That competition would continue to shrink type A sharing. It <br>
would inspire an extraordinary range of new innovators&mdash;ones who <br>
would have a right to the content, and would no longer fear the uncer-tain <br>
and barbarically severe punishments of the law. <br>
In summary, then, my proposal is this: <br>

The Internet is in transition. We should not be regulating a tech-nology <br>
in transition. We should instead be regulating to minimize the <br>
harm to interests affected by this technological change, while enabling, <br>
and encouraging, the most efficient technology we can create. <br>
We can minimize that harm while maximizing the benefit to inno-vation <br>
by <br>
</p><p>
1. guaranteeing the right to engage in type D sharing; <br>
2. permitting noncommercial type C sharing without liability, <br>
and commercial type C sharing at a low and fixed rate set by <br>
statute; <br>
3. while in this transition, taxing and compensating for type A <br>
sharing, to the extent actual harm is demonstrated. <br>
</p><p>
But what if "piracy" doesn't disappear? What if there is a competi-tive <br>
market providing content at a low cost, but a significant number of <br>
consumers continue to "take" content for nothing? Should the law do <br>
something then? <br>
Yes, it should. But, again, what it should do depends upon how the <br>
facts develop. These changes may not eliminate type A sharing. But <br>
the real issue is not whether it eliminates sharing in the abstract. <br>
The real issue is its effect on the market. Is it better (a) to have a tech-nology <br>
that is 95 percent secure and produces a market of size <i>x, </i>or <br>
(b) to have a technology that is 50 percent secure but produces a mar-ket <br>
of five times <i>x? </i>Less secure might produce more unauthorized <br>
sharing, but it is likely to also produce a much bigger market in au-thorized <br>
sharing. The most important thing is to assure artists' com-pensation <br>
without breaking the Internet. Once that's assured, then it <br>
may well be appropriate to find ways to track down the petty pirates. <br>
But we're a long way away from whittling the problem down to this <br>
subset of type A sharers. And our focus until we're there should not be <br>
on finding ways to break the Internet. Our focus until we're there <br>

space for innovation and creativity that the Internet is. <br>
</p><p>
<tt>5. Fire Lots of Lawyers <br>
</tt>I'm a lawyer. I make lawyers for a living. I believe in the law. I believe <br>
in the law of copyright. Indeed, I have devoted my life to working in <br>
law, not because there are big bucks at the end but because there are <br>
ideals at the end that I would love to live. <br>
Yet much of this book has been a criticism of lawyers, or the role <br>
lawyers have played in this debate. The law speaks to ideals, but it is <br>
my view that our profession has become too attuned to the client. And <br>
in a world where the rich clients have one strong view, the unwilling-ness <br>
of the profession to question or counter that one strong view queers <br>
the law. <br>
The evidence of this bending is compelling. I'm attacked as a "rad-ical" <br>
by many within the profession, yet the positions that I am advo-cating <br>
are precisely the positions of some of the most moderate and <br>
significant figures in the history of this branch of the law. Many, for ex-ample, <br>
thought crazy the challenge that we brought to the Copyright <br>
Term Extension Act. Yet just thirty years ago, the dominant scholar <br>
and practitioner in the field of copyright, Melville Nimmer, thought it <br>
obvious. 10 <br>
However, my criticism of the role that lawyers have played in this <br>
debate is not just about a professional bias. It is more importantly <br>
about our failure to actually reckon the costs of the law. <br>
Economists are supposed to be good at reckoning costs and bene-fits. <br>
But more often than not, economists, with no clue about how the <br>
legal system actually functions, simply assume that the transaction <br>
costs of the legal system are slight. 11 They see a system that has been <br>
around for hundreds of years, and they assume it works the way their <br>
elementary school civics class taught them it works. <br>

<strong><a name="page311"> Page 311</a></strong>
<a href="#page312">312</a>
<br>

But the legal system doesn't work. Or more accurately, it doesn't <br>
work for anyone except those with the most resources. Not because the <br>
system is corrupt. I don't think our legal system (at the federal level, at <br>
least) is at all corrupt. I mean simply because the costs of our legal sys-tem <br>
are so astonishingly high that justice can practically never be done. <br>
These costs distort free culture in many ways. A lawyer's time is <br>
billed at the largest firms at more than $400 per hour. How much time <br>
should such a lawyer spend reading cases carefully, or researching ob-scure <br>
strands of authority? The answer is the increasing reality: very lit-tle. <br>
The law depended upon the careful articulation and development <br>
of doctrine, but the careful articulation and development of legal doc-trine <br>
depends upon careful work. Yet that careful work costs too much, <br>
except in the most high-profile and costly cases. <br>
The costliness and clumsiness and randomness of this system mock <br>
our tradition. And lawyers, as well as academics, should consider it <br>
their duty to change the way the law works&mdash;or better, to change the <br>
law so that it works. It is wrong that the system works well only for the <br>
top 1 percent of the clients. It could be made radically more efficient, <br>
and inexpensive, and hence radically more just. <br>
But until that reform is complete, we as a society should keep the <br>
law away from areas that we know it will only harm. And that is pre-cisely <br>
what the law will too often do if too much of our culture is left <br>
to its review. <br>
Think about the amazing things your kid could do or make with <br>
digital technology&mdash;the film, the music, the Web page, the blog. Or <br>
think about the amazing things your community could facilitate with <br>
digital technology&mdash;a wiki, a barn raising, activism to change some-thing. <br>
Think about all those creative things, and then imagine cold <br>
molasses poured onto the machines. This is what any regime that re-quires <br>
permission produces. Again, this is the reality of Brezhnev's <br>
Russia. <br>
The law should regulate in certain areas of culture&mdash;but it should <br>
regulate culture only where that regulation does good. Yet lawyers <br>

rarely test their power, or the power they promote, against this simple <br>
pragmatic question: "Will it do good?" When challenged about the ex-panding <br>
reach of the law, the lawyer answers, "Why not?" <br>
We should ask, "Why?" Show me why your regulation of culture is <br>
needed. Show me how it does good. And until you can show me both, <br>
keep your lawyers away. <br>

and the proportion renewing. Thus, if 100 copyrights are registered in year <br>
1, and only 15 are renewed, and the renewal term is 28 years, then the aver-age <br>
term is 32.2 years. For the renewal data and other relevant data, see the <br>
Web site associated with this book, available at link #6. <br>

Why All the Comics My Kid Watches Are Japanese Imports?" <i>Rutgers Law <br>
Review </i>55 (2002): 155, 182. "[ T] here might be a collective economic ra-tionality <br>
that would lead manga and anime artists to forgo bringing legal <br>
actions for infringement. One hypothesis is that all manga artists may be <br>
better off collectively if they set aside their individual self-interest and de-cide <br>
not to press their legal rights. This is essentially a prisoner's dilemma <br>
solved." <br>
7. The term <i>intellectual property </i>is of relatively recent origin. See Siva Vaid-hyanathan, <br>
<i>Copyrights and Copywrongs, </i>11 (New York: New York Univer-sity <br>
Press, 2001). See also Lawrence Lessig, <i>The Future of Ideas </i>(New York: <br>
Random House, 2001), 293 n. 26. The term accurately describes a set of <br>
"property" rights&mdash;copyright, patents, trademark, and trade-secret&mdash;but the <br>
nature of those rights is very different. <br>

the Knowledge Economy? </i>(New York: The New Press, 2003), 10Ð 13, 209. <br>
The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agree-ment <br>
obligates member nations to create administrative and enforcement <br>
mechanisms for intellectual property rights, a costly proposition for devel-oping <br>
countries. Additionally, patent rights may lead to higher prices for <br>
staple industries such as agriculture. Critics of TRIPS question the dispar-ity <br>
between burdens imposed upon developing countries and benefits con-ferred <br>
to industrialized nations. TRIPS does permit governments to use <br>
patents for public, noncommercial uses without first obtaining the patent <br>
holder's permission. Developing nations may be able to use this to gain the <br>
benefits of foreign patents at lower prices. This is a promising strategy for <br>
developing nations within the TRIPS framework. <br>
3. For an analysis of the economic impact of copying technology, see Stan <br>
Liebowitz, <i>Rethinking the Network Economy </i>(New York: Amacom, 2002), <br>
144Ð 90. "In some instances ... the impact of piracy on the copyright holder's <br>
ability to appropriate the value of the work will be negligible. One obvious in-stance <br>
is the case where the individual engaging in pirating would not have <br>
purchased an original even if pirating were not an option." Ibid., 149. <br>

up with the most creative, paradigm-shifting uses for their own products. <br>
This job usually falls to outside innovators, who reassemble existing tech-nology <br>

24. These are the most important instances in our history, but there are other <br>
cases as well. The technology of digital audio tape (DAT), for example, <br>
was regulated by Congress to minimize the risk of piracy. The remedy <br>
Congress imposed did burden DAT producers, by taxing tape sales and <br>
controlling the technology of DAT. See Audio Home Recording Act of <br>
1992 (Title 17 of the <i>United States Code), </i>Pub. L. No. 102-563, 106 Stat. <br>

A property right is simply a right that an individual has against the <br>
world to do or not do certain things that may or may not attach to a phys-ical <br>
object. The right itself is intangible, even if the object to which it is <br>
(metaphorically) attached is tangible. See Adam Mossoff, "What Is Prop-erty? <br>

</tt>1. Jacob Tonson is typically remembered for his associations with prominent <br>
eighteenth-century literary figures, especially John Dryden, and for his <br>
handsome "definitive editions" of classic works. In addition to <i>Romeo and <br>
Juliet, </i>he published an astonishing array of works that still remain at the <br>
heart of the English canon, including collected works of Shakespeare, Ben <br>
Jonson, John Milton, and John Dryden. See Keith Walker, "Jacob Tonson, <br>

rights an artist has to control the commercial exploitation of his im-age. <br>

the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, 97th <br>

2. Lawyers speak of "property" not as an absolute thing, but as a bundle of <br>
rights that are sometimes associated with a particular object. Thus, my <br>
"property right" to my car gives me the right to exclusive use, but not the <br>
right to drive at 150 miles an hour. For the best effort to connect the ordi-nary <br>
meaning of "property" to "lawyer talk," see Bruce Ackerman, <i>Private <br>
Property and the Constitution </i>(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977), <br>
26Ð 27. <br>
3. By describing the way law affects the other three modalities, I don't mean <br>
to suggest that the other three don't affect law. Obviously, they do. Law's <br>
only distinction is that it alone speaks as if it has a right self-consciously to <br>
change the other three. The right of the other three is more timidly ex-pressed. <br>

4. Some people object to this way of talking about "liberty." They object be-cause <br>
their focus when considering the constraints that exist at any partic-ular <br>
moment are constraints imposed exclusively by the government. For <br>
instance, if a storm destroys a bridge, these people think it is meaningless <br>
to say that one's liberty has been restrained. A bridge has washed out, and <br>
it's harder to get from one place to another. To talk about this as a loss of <br>
freedom, they say, is to confuse the stuff of politics with the vagaries of or-dinary <br>
life. <br>
I don't mean to deny the value in this narrower view, which depends <br>
upon the context of the inquiry. I do, however, mean to argue against any <br>
insistence that this narrower view is the only proper view of liberty. As I <br>
argued in <i>Code, </i>we come from a long tradition of political thought with a <br>
broader focus than the narrow question of what the government did when. <br>
John Stuart Mill defended freedom of speech, for example, from the <br>
tyranny of narrow minds, not from the fear of government prosecution; <br>
John Stuart Mill, <i>On Liberty </i>(Indiana: Hackett Publishing Co., 1978), 19. <br>
John R. Commons famously defended the economic freedom of labor <br>
from constraints imposed by the market; John R. Commons, "The Right <br>
to Work," in Malcom Rutherford and Warren J. Samuels, eds., <i>John R. <br>
Commons: Selected Essays </i>(London: Routledge: 1997), 62. The Americans <br>
with Disabilities Act increases the liberty of people with physical disabili-ties <br>
by changing the architecture of certain public places, thereby making <br>
access to those places easier; 42 <i>United States Code, </i>section 12101 (2000). <br>
Each of these interventions to change existing conditions changes the <br>
liberty of a particular group. The effect of those interventions should be <br>
accounted for in order to understand the effective liberty that each of these <br>
groups might face. <br>

1799, only 556 copyright registrations were filed; John Tebbel, <i>A History of <br>
Book Publishing in the United States, </i>vol. 1, <i>The Creation of an Industry, <br>
1630Ð 1865 </i>(New York: Bowker, 1972), 141. Of the 21,000 imprints <br>
recorded before 1790, only twelve were copyrighted under the 1790 act; <br>
William J. Maher, <i>Copyright Term, Retrospective Extension and the Copy-right <br>
Law of 1790 in Historical Context, </i>7Ð 10 (2002), available at link #25. <br>
Thus, the overwhelming majority of works fell immediately into the pub-lic <br>
domain. Even those works that were copyrighted fell into the public <br>
domain quickly, because the term of copyright was short. The initial term <br>
of copyright was fourteen years, with the option of renewal for an addi-tional <br>
fourteen years. Copyright Act of May 31, 1790, §1, 1 stat. 124. <br>
10. Few copyright holders ever chose to renew their copyrights. For instance, <br>
of the 25,006 copyrights registered in 1883, only 894 were renewed in <br>
1910. For a year-by-year analysis of copyright renewal rates, see Barbara <br>
A. Ringer, "Study No. 31: Renewal of Copyright," <i>Studies on Copyright, <br>
</i>vol. 1 (New York: Practicing Law Institute, 1963), 618. For a more recent <br>
and comprehensive analysis, see William M. Landes and Richard A. Pos-ner, <br>
"Indefinitely Renewable Copyright," <i>University of Chicago Law Re-view <br>
</i>70 (2003): 471, 498Ð 501, and accompanying figures. <br>
11. See Ringer, ch. 9, n. 2. <br>
12. These statistics are understated. Between the years 1910 and 1962 (the <br>
first year the renewal term was extended), the average term was never <br>
more than thirty-two years, and averaged thirty years. See Landes and <br>
Posner, "Indefinitely Renewable Copyright," loc. cit. <br>
13. See Thomas Bender and David Sampliner, "Poets, Pirates, and the Cre-ation <br>
of American Literature," 29 <i>New York University Journal of Interna-tional <br>
Law and Politics </i>255 (1997), and James Gilraeth, ed., Federal <br>
Copyright Records, 1790Ð 1800 (U. S. G. P. O., 1987). <br>
14. Jonathan Zittrain, "The Copyright Cage," <i>Legal Affairs, </i>July/ August <br>

15. Professor Rubenfeld has presented a powerful constitutional argument <br>
about the difference that copyright law should draw (from the perspective <br>
of the First Amendment) between mere "copies" and derivative works. See <br>
Jed Rubenfeld, "The Freedom of Imagination: Copyright's Constitution-ality," <br>
<i>Yale Law Journal </i>112 (2002): 1Ð 60 (see especially pp. 53Ð 59). <br>
16. This is a simplification of the law, but not much of one. The law certainly <br>
regulates more than "copies"&mdash;a public performance of a copyrighted <br>
song, for example, is regulated even though performance per se doesn't <br>
make a copy; 17 <i>United States Code, </i>section 106( 4). And it certainly some-times <br>
doesn't regulate a "copy"; 17 <i>United States Code, </i>section 112( a). But <br>
the presumption under the existing law (which regulates "copies;" 17 <br>
<i>United States Code, </i>section 102) is that if there is a copy, there is a right. <br>
17. Thus, my argument is not that in each place that copyright law extends, <br>

we should repeal it. It is instead that we should have a good argument for <br>
its extending where it does, and should not determine its reach on the ba-sis <br>
of arbitrary and automatic changes caused by technology. <br>
18. I don't mean "nature" in the sense that it couldn't be different, but rather that <br>
its present instantiation entails a copy. Optical networks need not make <br>
copies of content they transmit, and a digital network could be designed to <br>
delete anything it copies so that the same number of copies remain. <br>

21. In principle, a contract might impose a requirement on me. I might, for <br>
example, buy a book from you that includes a contract that says I will read <br>
it only three times, or that I promise to read it three times. But that obli-gation <br>
(and the limits for creating that obligation) would come from the <br>
contract, not from copyright law, and the obligations of contract would <br>
not necessarily pass to anyone who subsequently acquired the book. <br>

34. The Marijuana Policy Project, in February 2003, sought to place ads that <br>
directly responded to the Nick and Norm series on stations within the <br>
Washington, D. C., area. Comcast rejected the ads as "against [their] pol-icy." <br>
The local NBC affiliate, WRC, rejected the ads without reviewing <br>
them. The local ABC affiliate, WJOA, originally agreed to run the ads and <br>
accepted payment to do so, but later decided not to run the ads and re-turned <br>
the collected fees. Interview with Neal Levine, 15 October 2003. <br>
These restrictions are, of course, not limited to drug policy. See, for ex-ample, <br>
Nat Ives, "On the Issue of an Iraq War, Advocacy Ads Meet with <br>
Rejection from TV Networks," <i>New York Times, </i>13 March 2003, C4. Out-side <br>
of election-related air time there is very little that the FCC or the <br>
courts are willing to do to even the playing field. For a general overview, <br>
see Rhonda Brown, "Ad Hoc Access: The Regulation of Editorial Adver-tising <br>
on Television and Radio," <i>Yale Law and Policy Review </i>6 (1988): <br>
449Ð 79, and for a more recent summary of the stance of the FCC and the <br>
courts, see <i>Radio-Television News Directors Association </i>v. <i>FCC, </i>184 F. 3d <br>
872 (D. C. Cir. 1999). Municipal authorities exercise the same authority as <br>
the networks. In a recent example from San Francisco, the San Francisco <br>
transit authority rejected an ad that criticized its Muni diesel buses. Phillip <br>
Matier and Andrew Ross, "Antidiesel Group Fuming After Muni Rejects <br>
Ad," SFGate. com, 16 June 2003, available at link #32. The ground was <br>
that the criticism was "too controversial." <br>

Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, "Copy-right <br>
and Digital Media in a Post-Napster World," 27 June 2003, available <br>

(D-Calif.) have introduced a bill that would treat unauthorized on-line <br>
copying as a felony offense with punishments ranging as high as five years <br>
imprisonment; see Jon Healey, "House Bill Aims to Up Stakes on Piracy," <br>
<i>Los Angeles Times, </i>17 July 2003, available at link #34. Civil penalties are <br>
currently set at $150,000 per copied song. For a recent (and unsuccessful) <br>
legal challenge to the RIAA's demand that an ISP reveal the identity of a <br>
user accused of sharing more than 600 songs through a family computer, <br>
see <i>RIAA </i>v. <i>Ver izon Internet Services (In re. Verizon Internet Services), </i>240 F. <br>
Supp. 2d 24 (D. D. C. 2003). Such a user could face liability ranging as <br>
high as $90 million. Such astronomical figures furnish the RIAA with a <br>
powerful arsenal in its prosecution of file sharers. Settlements ranging <br>
from $12,000 to $17,500 for four students accused of heavy file sharing on <br>
university networks must have seemed a mere pittance next to the $98 bil-lion <br>
the RIAA could seek should the matter proceed to court. See Eliza-beth <br>

of America (RIAA) </i>v. <i>Diamond Multimedia Systems, </i>180 F. 3d 1072 (9th <br>
Cir. 1999). There the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit reasoned that <br>
makers of a portable MP3 player were not liable for contributory copy-right <br>
infringement for a device that is unable to record or redistribute mu-sic <br>
(a device whose only copying function is to render portable a music file <br>
already stored on a user's hard drive). <br>
At the district court level, the only exception is found in <i>Metro-Goldwyn-<br>
Mayer Studios, Inc. </i>v. <i>Grokster, Ltd., </i>259 F. Supp. 2d 1029 (C. D. <br>
Cal., 2003), where the court found the link between the distributor and <br>
any given user's conduct too attenuated to make the distributor liable for <br>
contributory or vicarious infringement liability. <br>

11. For example, in July 2002, Representative Howard Berman introduced the <br>
Peer-to-Peer Piracy Prevention Act (H. R. 5211), which would immunize <br>
copyright holders from liability for damage done to computers when the <br>
copyright holders use technology to stop copyright infringement. In Au-gust <br>
2002, Representative Billy Tauzin introduced a bill to mandate that <br>
technologies capable of rebroadcasting digital copies of films broadcast on <br>
TV (i. e., computers) respect a "broadcast flag" that would disable copying <br>
of that content. And in March of the same year, Senator Fritz Hollings <br>
introduced the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion <br>
Act, which mandated copyright protection technology in all digital media <br>
devices. See GartnerG2, "Copyright and Digital Media in a Post-Napster <br>

old-fashioned entry barriers. Analog radio stations are protected from dig-ital <br>
entrants, reducing entry in radio and diversity. Yes, this is done in the <br>
name of getting royalties to copyright holders, but, absent the play of pow-erful <br>
interests, that could have been done in a media-neutral way." <br>

<tt>CHAPTER THIRTEEN: ELDRED <br>
</tt>1. There's a parallel here with pornography that is a bit hard to describe, but <br>
it's a strong one. One phenomenon that the Internet created was a world <br>
of noncommercial pornographers&mdash;people who were distributing porn <br>
but were not making money directly or indirectly from that distribution. <br>
Such a class didn't exist before the Internet came into being because the <br>
costs of distributing porn were so high. Yet this new class of distributors <br>
got special attention in the Supreme Court, when the Court struck down <br>
the Communications Decency Act of 1996. It was partly because of the <br>
burden on noncommercial speakers that the statute was found to exceed <br>
Congress's power. The same point could have been made about noncom-mercial <br>
publishers after the advent of the Internet. The Eric Eldreds of the <br>
world before the Internet were extremely few. Yet one would think it at <br>
least as important to protect the Eldreds of the world as to protect non-commercial <br>
pornographers. <br>

of the Commerce Clause was that the interpretation offered by the <br>

commerce&mdash;the limitation to interstate commerce notwithstanding. The <br>
same point is true in the context of the Copyright Clause. Here, too, the <br>
government's interpretation would allow the government unending power <br>
to regulate copyrights&mdash;the limitation to "limited times" notwithstanding. <br>

<tt>CHAPTER FOURTEEN: ELDRED II <br>
</tt>1. Until the 1908 Berlin Act of the Berne Convention, national copyright <br>
legislation sometimes made protection depend upon compliance with for-malities <br>
such as registration, deposit, and affixation of notice of the au-thor's <br>
claim of copyright. However, starting with the 1908 act, every text <br>
of the Convention has provided that "the enjoyment and the exercise" of <br>
rights guaranteed by the Convention "shall not be subject to any formal-ity." <br>
The prohibition against formalities is presently embodied in Article <br>
5( 2) of the Paris Text of the Berne Convention. Many countries continue <br>
to impose some form of deposit or registration requirement, albeit not as <br>
a condition of copyright. French law, for example, requires the deposit of <br>
copies of works in national repositories, principally the National Museum. <br>
Copies of books published in the United Kingdom must be deposited in <br>
the British Library. The German Copyright Act provides for a Registrar <br>
of Authors where the author's true name can be filed in the case of anony-mous <br>
or pseudonymous works. Paul Goldstein, <i>International Intellectual <br>
Property Law, Cases and Materials </i>(New York: Foundation Press, 2001), <br>

8. Microsoft's position about free and open source software is more sophisti-cated. <br>
As it has repeatedly asserted, it has no problem with "open source" <br>
software or software in the public domain. Microsoft's principal opposi-tion <br>
is to "free software" licensed under a "copyleft" license, meaning a li-cense <br>
that requires the licensee to adopt the same terms on any derivative <br>
work. See Bradford L. Smith, "The Future of Software: Enabling the Mar-ketplace <br>

<tt>THEM, SOON <br>
</tt>1. The proposal I am advancing here would apply to American works only. <br>
Obviously, I believe it would be beneficial for the same idea to be adopted <br>
by other countries as well. <br>
2. There would be a complication with derivative works that I have not <br>
solved here. In my view, the law of derivatives creates a more complicated <br>
system than is justified by the marginal incentive it creates. <br>

Fisher's proposal is very similar to Richard Stallman's proposal for <br>
DAT. Unlike Fisher's, Stallman's proposal would not pay artists directly <br>
proportionally, though more popular artists would get more than the less <br>
popular. As is typical with Stallman, his proposal predates the current de-bate <br>
by about a decade. See link #85. <br>
10. Lawrence Lessig, "Copyright's First Amendment" (Melville B. Nimmer <br>
Memorial Lecture), <i>UCLA Law Review </i>48 (2001): 1057, 1069Ð 70. <br>
11. A good example is the work of Professor Stan Liebowitz. Liebowitz is to <br>
be commended for his careful review of data about infringement, leading <br>
him to question his own publicly stated position&mdash;twice. He initially pre-dicted <br>
that downloading would substantially harm the industry. He then <br>
revised his view in light of the data, and he has since revised his view again. <br>
Compare Stan J. Liebowitz, <i>Rethinking the Network Economy: The True <br>
Forces That Drive the Digital Marketplace </i>(New York: Amacom, 2002), 173 <br>
(reviewing his original view but expressing skepticism) with Stan J. <br>
Liebowitz, "Will MP3s Annihilate the Record Industry?" working paper, <br>
June 2003, available at link #86. <br>
Liebowitz's careful analysis is extremely valuable in estimating the ef-fect <br>
of file-sharing technology. In my view, however, he underestimates the <br>
costs of the legal system. See, for example, <i>Rethinking, </i>174Ð 76. <br>

</tt>This book is the product of a long and as yet unsuccessful struggle that <br>
began when I read of Eric Eldred's war to keep books free. Eldred's <br>
work helped launch a movement, the free culture movement, and it is <br>
to him that this book is dedicated. <br>
I received guidance in various places from friends and academics, <br>
including Glenn Brown, Peter DiCola, Jennifer Mnookin, Richard <br>
Posner, Mark Rose, and Kathleen Sullivan. And I received correction <br>
and guidance from many amazing students at Stanford Law School <br>
and Stanford University. They included Andrew B. Coan, John Eden, <br>
James P. Fellers, Christopher Guzelian, Erica Goldberg, Robert Hall-man, <br>
Andrew Harris, Matthew Kahn, Brian Link, Ohad Mayblum, <br>
Alina Ng, and Erica Platt. I am particularly grateful to Catherine <br>
Crump and Harry Surden, who helped direct their research, and to <br>
Laura Lynch, who brilliantly managed the army that they assembled, <br>
and provided her own critical eye on much of this. <br>
Yuko Noguchi helped me to understand the laws of Japan as well as <br>
its culture. I am thankful to her, and to the many in Japan who helped <br>
me prepare this book: Joi Ito, Takayuki Matsutani, Naoto Misaki, <br>
Michihiro Sasaki, Hiromichi Tanaka, Hiroo Yamagata, and Yoshihiro <br>

Yonezawa. I am thankful as well as to Professor Nobuhiro Nakayama, <br>
and the Tokyo University Business Law Center, for giving me the <br>
chance to spend time in Japan, and to Tadashi Shiraishi and Kiyokazu <br>
Yamagami for their generous help while I was there. <br>
These are the traditional sorts of help that academics regularly <br>
draw upon. But in addition to them, the Internet has made it possible <br>
to receive advice and correction from many whom I have never even <br>
met. Among those who have responded with extremely helpful advice <br>
to requests on my blog about the book are Dr. Mohammad Al-Ubaydli, <br>
David Gerstein, and Peter DiMauro, as well as a long list of those who <br>
had specific ideas about ways to develop my argument. They included <br>
Richard Bondi, Steven Cherry, David Coe, Nik Cubrilovic, Bob <br>
Devine, Charles Eicher, Thomas Guida, Elihu M. Gerson, Jeremy <br>
Hunsinger, Vaughn Iverson, John Karabaic, Jeff Keltner, James Lin-denschmidt, <br>
K. L. Mann, Mark Manning, Nora McCauley, Jeffrey <br>
McHugh, Evan McMullen, Fred Norton, John Pormann, Pedro A. D. <br>
Rezende, Shabbir Safdar, Saul Schleimer, Clay Shirky, Adam Shostack, <br>
Kragen Sitaker, Chris Smith, Bruce Steinberg, Andrzej Jan Taramina, <br>
Sean Walsh, Matt Wasserman, Miljenko Williams, "Wink," Roger <br>
Wood, "Ximmbo da Jazz," and Richard Yanco. (I apologize if I have <br>
missed anyone; with computers come glitches, and a crash of my <br>
e-mail system meant I lost a bunch of great replies.) <br>
Richard Stallman and Michael Carroll each read the whole book <br>
in draft, and each provided extremely helpful correction and advice. <br>
Michael helped me to see more clearly the significance of the regula-tion <br>
of derivitive works. And Richard corrected an embarrassingly large <br>
number of errors. While my work is in part inspired by Stallman's, he <br>
does not agree with me in important places throughout this book. <br>
Finally, and forever, I am thankful to Bettina, who has always in-sisted <br>
that there would be unending happiness away from these battles, <br>
and who has always been right. This slow learner is, as ever, grateful for <br>
her perpetual patience and love. <br>
