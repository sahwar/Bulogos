# What is/was _The Bulogos Project_? #

The Bulogos Project is/was a collection of my own personal projects, originating from my childhood technoutopian fantasies and later, more realistic and do-able IT/translation&linguistics projects.

A partial list of the subprojects (and also incomplete as the original research papers of many of the projects span hunderds of very long .txt files circa the years pre-2010–2019 and employing both original research&ideas, and many remixology/copy&paste&tweak ideas):
