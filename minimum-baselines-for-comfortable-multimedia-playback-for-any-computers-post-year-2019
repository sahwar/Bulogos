* (very low-powered devices may use sRGB 16+-million-color _user-selectable_-rescaling-algorithms-powered <=480p (or <=800x600px) screen-display resolution with a good average/fixed 25-30fps+ refresh-rate; visual panning&zooming in/out & pause/resume at-frame/timecode-position features must be built-in on the software, OS, and hardware and firmware sides, with software video acceleration and/or hardware video acceleration, etc. ...)
---
* 480p (with some minites of pre-buffered video+audio frames/PCM-/etc-audiostream - to reduce latency/lag) = absolute base minimum for smartphones, digital tablets, post-2000-2008 laptops; it should be suitable even for slower unlimited-monthly-bandwidth cheap(-enough) ISP-Internet-home/office/work-plans @ 56K+/96K-512K+/<=100mbit/s full-duplex (download & upload speeds almost the same...) ADSL/phone-modem/2G+ cable/wireless Internet connections [speeds, with 99.9% uptime & phone/email/IM&VoIP live human professional support...]

* 720p = sweetspot!!! - recommended comfortable medium baseline for post-2010-manufactured computer devices (laptops, desktop PCs, smartphones, smart tablets, phablets, smart TV boxes, etc.) + built-in support for multiple UTF-8 Unicode encoded text-formats-based subtitle-fileformats, with a basic GUI&CLI&WebUI way for the user to select NONE or simultaneous running/display (visually non-overlapping of; adjustable location relative to frames sizes) pf one or more of these built-in-OR-user-supplied-via-GUI/CLI/WebUI (MKV->MKVcleaver, etc.; MP4->export subtitle-track/audio-track...) subtitle soft-subs files and/or dub(bing)s audio-streams [see http://aegisub.org open-source/free-software subtitle editor/maker, Subtitle Workshop (latest), Gaupol, Jubler, gnome subtitle editor, etc... any editor can also be used (e.g. notepad++, notepad2-mod, notepad3, GNU nano, etc.) + spellchecker engine]...
The resolution of 1280x800 is considered the comfortable minimum for smartphones (e.g. tough durable CAT (brand) smartphones & tablets) and laptops and Wacom-Cintiq-like screen-display graphics tablets, with IPS/IPS+ (PWM-less!) or better as the preferred recommended display matrix --- see http://tftcentral.co.uk for technical explanation + reddit.com/stylus & reddit.com/graphicstablets & /r/graphics & /r/digitalart , deviantart.com, artstation.com, cgsociety.org, pixeljoint.net, etc.

* 1080p = baseline for post-2015 Intel i5 CPU (or up) or comparable AMD CPUs or ARMv6-v8+_x64 ones, 4-16GiB+-RAM HDD/SSD-swappable-1TiB-10-100-500+-TiB-capable laptops and smart devices (matte/laminated true-8-bit-sRGB-colorspace PWN-less IPS/better = recommended...). Note that this is 1920x1080_P_, not 1920x1080i (interlaced)!!!
* 1080p+ = 1920x1200 (e.g. 2nd-hand non-broken working almost-pristine HP lp2475w (8-bit-sRGB IPS display monitor, very good colors&angles), made in XXXX?) or up, and above 2K, 4K+ = for medium-to-high-end display monitors & smart-devices, speedcams, etc.
