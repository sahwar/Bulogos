# About this project - –ó–∞ —Ç–æ–∑–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–µ–∫—Ç

### Bulogos /b…§l…îg…îs/, /b…§l…ôg…îs/ (–ë—ä–ª–æ–≥–æ—Å / –ë—ä–ª–™–≥–æ—Å); The Bulogos Project; Project Bulogos
:us: :gb: Useful information for Bulgarian-language users of Linux and FOSS/FLOSS (Free (, libre) and open-source software), among other things.
It also hosts some of my (i.e. sahwar's) various experimental R&D research papers.

:us: :gb: Due to overdoing it and overengineering it and due to creeping featurism (my quest to add as many files as possible - relevant to Bulgarian-language use of computers and Cyrillization of computers - to the Bulogos project here), feature bloat, and diminishing returns, I have at some point added too many files with unknown licenses or even non-free licenses. I will most likely remove all these non-free-licensed files from Bulogos and add links to download these nonfree files from 3rd-party websites under fair-use terms, so as to comply with the GitHub rules for licensing of files in GitHub repositories. However, this task takes quite a lot of time, so, unfortunalely, some of these nonfree copyrighted files (which were obtained from elsewhere and created by other people) may still be found among the other files in the Bulogos repository for the foreseeable future despite my efforts to move them out of this repository, and to then only place hyperlinks to download these files from elsewhere, so as not to burden the reputation of this project but still offer these files to the benefit of interested users.
All these 'problematic' files from 3rd-parties will eventually be listed in the file [CREDITS_FAIR-USE.txt](https://github.com/sahwar/Bulogos/blob/master/CREDITS_FAIR-USE.txt).

_**My personal philosophical view** is that all works ever created can be paralegally used under fair-use terms or public-domain terms (since it's all God-Devil's=the Universe's creative expression, all of it...), but since not everyone agrees with that (especially moneygrabbing laywers and patent trolls and patent lawsuits), and since content-production creative professionals also need to earn their living also via earning money from their works by selling (physical and/or digital) COPIES of them, I am forced to eventually accomplish the long-term task as explained in the previous paragraph despite personal objection towards and disdain for 'plagiarism' as a concept, and also disdain for out-of-control copyright crushing innovation by putting money earnings over everything, and also disdain for abusing author's rights by megacorporations and creative license-labels..._

## The meaning of [your] life and the purpose of life
Meaning: no meaning but what you put into it, mainly just to live and be alive and to make babies, and to survive till you can/want and to do whatever you want (within some reasonable limits...).

Purpose: no purpose, just do want you want but don't physically hurt others too much (except sex&pregnancy) - https://xkcd.com/387/

To sum up: Work on yourself (body and consciousness and practical physical skills) and earn some resources, socialize, market yourself&develop basic business skills, earn cash money, respect, and get women, save some money, take care of own kids, practise hobbies, retire, etc.
