(photograph/shoot high-resolution 24-bit/32-bit full-color(/greyscale)photos of almost old
old manuscripts and print publications which are primarily written
in the old Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabet(s)/scripts,
and then extract the glyphs/characters & glyph variations that differ too much,
and use a trained artificial neural-network algorithm to sift through
the scanned characters and determine which glyphs visually differ the most, and
then extract those and perform an operation similar to a *visual* `$ sort | uniq` on the end-result dataset,
and then maybe publish an article about that...)

To maybe suggest this idea for a research project
to be researched by the Bulgarian National Library & the bugger libraries in Bulgaria,
and by the IBL (Institute for the Bulgarian Language) at the BAS (Bulgarian Academy of Sciences of Bulgaria),
and by Linguistics, Philology, and History departments of the major universities in Bulgaria, in cooperation
with foreign archives that feature large collections of old (pre-1970) Glagolitic & Cyrillic texts/writings...

NOTE:
Results from this research and from modern Cyrillic fonts glyph-variation/variant comparison
and from http://cyrillic.bg , may be used to propose new additions to the Cyrillic script
blocks of the next versions of the Unicode standard ( http://unicode.org )... üôÑü§ìüòé
