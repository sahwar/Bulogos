EXPERIMENTAL INTERSTELLAR SPACE PROTOCOL FOR OPTICAL-LIGHT DATA TRANSMISSION SIMILAR TO TCP/IP PACKET-SWITCHING & UDP;
OUTER SPACE (LIGHT-SIGNALS-BASED) {DUPLEX} INTERNET FTW!!! HELL YEAH & HEAVEN MEH...! :p

(TO PASTE MY R&D NOTES HERE LATER ON...)

1. BASIC IDEA

WE PUT A SPECIAL TRANSMISSION SCREEN ON EACH DUPLEX-COMMUNICATING SPACESHIP.
THAT SERVES TO SEND OPTICAL (LIGHT) SIGNALS (E.G. A CONCENTRATED ARRAY OF LASERS IS BEAMED BENEATH THE INTERACTIVE SPECIAL-QR GRID... & IS RECEIVED ON THE OTHER END
IN MILLISECONDS OR SECONDS, AND IS INTERPRETED ELECTRONICALLY ON A SIMILAR INTERACTIVE SPECIAL-QR CODE SURFACE (OR A QUADRAT RECEIVER SURFACE NEXT TO THE SENDING SURFACE...) 
ON-THE-FLY AS 'FRAMES' BLOCKS LIKE _TCP PACKET SWITCHING_) BETWEEN THE SPACESHIPS.

THE MESSAGES ARE CODED AS SPECIAL QR CODES FASHIONED AS A GRID OF 2 8X8 GRIDS (EACH 8X8 GRID IS MADE OF SMALLER 8X8 DOTS THAT REPRESENT DIGITAL BITS).
THE 2ND 8X8 GRID IS EITHER A) IDENTICAL (FOR CRC-LIKE CHECKSUM INTEGRITY OF THE MESSAGE), OR B) HAS INVERTED-BITS, OR IS C) MIRRORED HORIZONTALLY & (/OR) VERTICALLY.
THE MESSAGE BLOCK IS MADE OF SUCH QR CODES THAT ARE BEAMED AND ARE ALTERNATED EVERY 1-TO-N SECONDS, WITH SPECIAL CONTENTS FOR THE 'BEGIN/START' MESSAGE QR BLOCK & THE 'FINISH/END' QR BLOCK...
(or the QR code is made of 4096 bytes + overhead header & ending bytes with machine-/human-readable metadata & CRC checksums for file-integrity control like in TCP/IP.)

THE DATA ENCODED AS LIGHT BEHIND AN INTERACTIVE SPECIAL QR-CODE GRID (OF _BIG ENOUGH SIZE_ SO AS TO BE TRANSPORTABLE & TO BE TRANSFERRED OVER LARGE SPACE DISTANCES & STILL TO BE
ENOUGH READABLE AFTER TRANSPORT LIGHT-SIGNAL INTERFERENCE OR BLOCKS ON THE WAY (OR SPECKS OF DUST OR SPACE ROCKS, ETC.) CAN POTENTIALLY BE REFLECTED VIA A SERIES OF CARRIER AMPLIFIER
SATELLITES EQUIPPED WITH SUCH LASERS BEAMING BEHIND AN INTERACTIVE QR-CODE SURFACE & WITH AN ADDITIONAL RECEIVER SURFACE OF INCOMING (RECEIVED) QR-CODE LIGHT 'FRAMES' PER SECOND/MILLISECOND RECEIVER SURFACE
AND THEN ELECTRONICALLY DECODED INTO HUMAN-READABLE DATA AFTER STORAGE OF THE RECEIVED DATA IN (RESILIENT TO THE EXTREME CONDITIONS IN OUTER SPACE) DATA-BUFFER MEMORY STORAGE DEVICES,
AND POTENTIALLY ARCHIVED (MADE A BACKUP OF) INTO LASER-ETCHED/MECHANICALLY-SCRATCHED GLASS/STONE/CRYSTAL TABLETS THAT ARE ONLY MILLIMETERS DEEP AS SLOTS SO THEY CAN BE SCRATCHED FULLY
TO BE ERASED FROM PREVIOUS WRITTEN DATA & THEN BE ETCHED/SCRATCHED AGAIN UNTIL THE MATERIAL GETS TOO THIN TO BE USEABLE FOR FURTHER ERASING / DATA WRITING...

SUCH LIGHT SIGNALS COULD ENCODE EVEN VOXEL(-LIKE) (SORTA-INTERACTIVE) HOLOGRAPHIC 3D-HOLOGRAMS & 4D, 5D, ETC. GEOMETRY ASIDE FROM HUMAN-TEXT & ETC. FILES ENCODED AS BINARY DATA.

CAVEATS: 'GRAVITATIONAL LENSING/BENDING/TWISTING OF LIGHT... with minor or medium data-error or data-corruption as a result of it...'

ETC. ... TO PASTE MORE LATER ON...
