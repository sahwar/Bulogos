Google Android OS & app updates kill your smartphone's remaining free disk space and are often 
buggy and you sometimes need to fallback to using an older version which is mostly backwards 
compatible with the newer version.

Here is how to fix Google Android updates:

1. Updates must be applied as .patch files on top of the original .apk file.
Each .apk must must be structured like so:

.apk
/
/{files of the original first version .apk of the app...}
/{each-new-update}_{datetime-of-release}_{version-string}.patch
/{same as the line above, for each new update/version}
/applauncher.manifest # This file merely lists every version of the app, starting from the

 first version, one per line, with the last version having a special human+readable 
 ASCII/UTF-8 JSON-like metacharacters 
sequence which points to which .patch version is applied LAST and is the latest version 
which will be loaded when the user launches the app.
DESPITE POTENTIAL MAJOR PERFORMANCE OVERHEADS, the app loading is
done by loading the original first version of the files in the .apk (minus the above-explained 
.manifest file and minus any .patch files)
and then applying each consecutive .patch file till the last one, after which the app is loaded

 to the user.
The OS should provide an option to change which .patch version is being loaded last, thus

 effectively switching to another version of the app.
The OS should also store .zip backups of the last 2 working versions of each app (in

 source-code&binary-executable-form), for easier fallback to the last 2 working versions of 
 the app instead of using the OS's built-in feature to edit the .manifest file which sets 
 which .patch version to load for the particular app.

This should provide basic atomic-updates to the Google Android OS & especially app updates 
(which can't be mandatory & auto UNLESS the user has set that option in the Google Android OS 
settings!!!)
NOTE: The OS must calculate the free filesize & total filesize of the OS filesystem and the 
filesize of every app and all updates within every app, and display that information to the 
user upon offering to download or post-download install each app update and each OS update.
In case of lack of enough free space for an OS or app update, the user should be notified 
and the OS&hardware
must provide the free 100%-working functionality to store new .patch updates into an inserted

 SD/SDHC/SDXC memory card (with some performance loss when loading an app from there!!!) AND 
 also to even store .patch updates and OS updates and .apk files onto a USB flash stick memory 
 card inserted via an OTG USB cable, or via WiFi Direct to an HDD/SSD of a another PC or via 
 Bluetooth 
to an HDD/SSD, or over the Internet to a remote web-server/PC via ssh / file.pizza / 
github.com/schollz/croc/Fram's f*exx&sexxx/RetroShare, etc. - if the user is on active WiFi 
connection to the Internet......

If a user wishes to permanently downgrade a particular app to an earlier version, he/she should 
just open the .apk archive of the app in the OS filesystem, and either just edit the .manifest 
file to point to a different older version .patch, or do the same but also delete the newer 
.patch files in the .apk (so you need to redownload the new updates if you later change your 
mind...)

NOTE2: Google Play & f-droid.org MUST start offering their OS & app downloads and updates with 
the option to select which version you wish to download, in a git-tree... This eliminates the 
problem of 'I can't find a particular update anywhere on the Internet...'. These downloads 
should also be offered via mirrorbrain.org mirrors (http, https, ftp, ftps/ftpes, ssh, .torrent,
.magnet, .meta4/.metalink, and optionally via open DC++/ADC p2p-filesharing hubs & as 
http-website offerring a .RSS webfeed which links to IRC(v3?)-DCC/SDCC/XDCC downloads...
