Alphabet, Armenian, Georgian, Thai, Yiddish, all Latin, Greek, and
Cyrillic characters, all mathematical symbols (including the entire
TeX repertoire), APL, Braille, Runes, and much more. 9x15 and 10x20
also cover Ethiopian.

</p><h2>Newly added fonts</h2>

<p>The following new "-misc-fixed-*" fonts were added:

</p><pre>  6x13O   -Misc-Fixed-Medium-O-SemiCondensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO10646-1
  7x13O   -Misc-Fixed-Medium-O-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-ISO10646-1
  8x13O   -Misc-Fixed-Medium-O-Normal--13-120-75-75-C-80-ISO10646-1
  9x18    -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--18-120-100-100-C-90-ISO10646-1
  9x18B   -Misc-Fixed-Bold-R-Normal--18-120-100-100-C-90-ISO10646-1
  12x13ja -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal-ja-13-120-75-75-C-120-ISO10646-1
  18x18ja -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal-ja-18-120-100-100-C-180-ISO10646-1
  18x18ko -Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal-ko-18-120-100-100-C-180-ISO10646-1
</pre>

<p>6x13O, 7x13O and 8x13O are oblique/italic versions of 6x13, 7x13
and 8x13. 9x18 is an improved version of 9x15 that has more space
above and below the base characters to increase readability and to
allow overstriking combining characters to work properly. 18x18ja and
18x18ko provide Japanese and Korean doublewidth ideograms for 9x18.
12x13ja provides Japanese doublewidth ideograms for 6x13.

</p><h2>Adobe BDF fonts</h2>

<p>I have also created revised ISO10646-1 versions of all the Adobe
and B&amp;H pixel fonts that come with X11R6.4. They contained about
30 additional Postscript characters (roughly the CP1252 repertoire)
that were present in the old ISO8859-1 BDF files, but were not encoded
and therefore not accessible for X clients.  The revised ISO10646-1
versions contain not only these but also many more automatically
generated accented Latin characters (e.g., all characters from ISO
8859 parts 1-4, 9-10, 13-15), and they also fix a few long-standing
bugs with the old fonts (missing NBSP, exchanged
multiplication/division sign, etc.).

</p><h2>Status</h2>

<p>The fonts are now completed and implement at present version 3.2 of
the Unicode standard (ISO 10646-1/Amd.1:2002). I will maintain them to
fix bugs and to satisfy any newly reported user requirements. Note
that the new fonts fix a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html">problem with the
Latin-1 quotation mark and accents</a>.

</p><h2>Download</h2>

<p>The fonts are freely available with installation instructions and

<p>There is also a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/download/ucs-fonts.changes">change log</a>
file for the "-misc-fixed-*" fonts.

</p><h2>Other character sets</h2>

<p>The font packages include the <samp>ucs2any.pl</samp> Perl script,
which converts ISO 10646-1 fonts into any other encoding for which
there is a <a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/">Unicode
mapping table</a> available. This way, you can quickly generate ISO
8859-* versions from the above fonts automatically, for the benefit of
older software that cannot yet handle ISO 10646-1 fonts directly.

</p><h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>I periodically contribute a recent snapshot of all of the above
fonts to <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> and they have
been shipping as part of the XFree86 releases since XFree86 4.1. I
have also made them available to <a href="http://www.x.org/">X.Org</a>
for inclusion into one of the next official X11 distributions as a
replacement for the current ISO 8859-1 BDF fonts (hopefully they will
be in X11R6.7). The copyright status of these fonts remains the same
as for the original fonts in the X11 distribution, therefore any X11
server vendors are welcome to include them into their products without
payment of royalties.

</li><li>To use these ISO10646-1 fonts, you will need applications that
support ISO10646-1 fonts (hardly any software released before ~2001
does). These are not simply 8-bit replacement fonts but usually need
to be used together with UTF-8 support in an application. For
instance, if you want to use these fonts with xterm, you need to use
an <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html#getxterm">xterm
version that can handle ISO10646-1 fonts</a> (e.g., the one in XFree86
4.x).

</li><li>Unicode and ISO 10646 merged CJK ideograph repertoires from
several groups of national source standards. In order to indicate that
an ISO10646-1 font with ideographic characters was designed following
the glyph style from one particular group of national source
standards, the <samp>ADD_STYLE_NAME</samp> XLFD field can be used to
indicate the corresponding language or region. Examples for such

<h2 id="indic">Why are there no Indic or Syriac glyphs in the ucs-fonts
package?</h2>

<p>In European and East Asian scripts, each Unicode character can be
represented by a single graphical shape ("glyph"). The X11 font system
is entirely built around the idea that there is a one-to-one
relationship between characters and glyphs, which works fine for
Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Han, Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, etc.
However, things are far more complicated for handwritten cursive
scripts such as Arabic, Syriac and the various Indic scripts
(Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu,
Kannada, etc.). For these scripts, the sequence of values
("characters") encoded in a Unicode string (which usually corresponds
to the sequence of keystrokes during entry and the sequence of
phonemes when speaking) first has to be converted into a sequence of
graphical symbols ("glyphs") as they are found in a font, before a
string can be displayed. In a given Latin font style, always the same
graphical glyph of a font will be used for representing a character on
a screen. In an Arabic or Indic font, the shape of the glyph depends
not only on the character that it represents, but also on its
neighbour characters. Sometimes, different glyphs have to be used
depending on the character appearing at the beginning, middle, or end
of a word, and often certain entire sequences of characters have to be
represented by a special ligature glyph. A very simple form of that is
used in Latin fine typography in the form of the "fi" and "fl"
ligatures, but in Indic scripts, the situation is far more extreme,
and the number of glyphs is often several times the number of
characters. For details and examples, read <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/ch09.pdf">Chapter 9</a>
and <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/ch08.pdf">Chapter
8</a> as well as the relevant <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">code charts</a> of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/u2.html">The Unicode
Standard</a>.

</p><p>The Unicode standard does contain encoding ranges for a simple
scheme of Arabic glyphs, the "Arabic Presentation Forms". This was
possible, because for Arabic there is a reasonably good consensus
among font designers on how many glyphs are actually necessary for
proper rendering of Arabic text, even though some argue that for
really high-quality typesetting the Unicode collection of Arabic
presentation forms is not sufficient. For Indic scripts on the other
hand, there seems no consensus among font designers, which glyphs are
actually necessary as this can vary significantly across different
font styles. Therefore, an Indic font is always a proprietary
non-standardized collection of glyphs together with a mapping table
that defines, how sequences of standard Unicode characters have to be
transformed into sequences of non-standard Indic glyphs from this
particular font, before the text can be displayed.

</p><p>The <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/">OpenType</a>
font format developed by Microsoft and Adobe is an outline font
format that does include such character/glyph mapping tables. The BDF
format used by X11 pixel fonts does not have any standardized way of
including a character/glyph mapping table, and neither do current BDF
editors such as xmbdfed or X servers. The <a href="http://www.pango.org/">Pango</a> rendering library developed
for the Gnome project can make use of BDF glyph fonts, but it requires
the corresponding character/glyph mapping table in a separate
client-side file. The X11 standards currently provide no support for
transmitting such mapping tables over the X11 protocol. Roman
Czyborra’s GNU Unifont does contain a naive representation of the
Indic glyphs shown in the Unicode Standard code charts, but that is of
no use in practice for displaying Indic strings properly.

</p><p>Summary: X11 was never designed for Arabic, Syriac, Indic, and
special libraries such as Pango have to be used for these scripts. If
you want to help getting Indic supported under X11, you have to extend
the X11 standards to fix this problem and provide a font mechanism
that understands that some scripts need to map characters into glyphs.
The solution is unfortunately not as easy as just drawing a few glyphs
with a font editor, otherwise we would already have added the Indic
scripts long ago to the ucs-fonts package.
