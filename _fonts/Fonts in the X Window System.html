            Fonts in the X Window System are available in these bitmap
            forms,
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <samp>.bdf</samp> (binary distribution format)
            </li>
            <li>
                <samp>.pcf</samp> (portable compiled format)
            </li>
            <li>
                <samp>.snf</samp> (server normal format)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            and on some systems, as outline fonts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <samp>.f3b</samp> (Sun Microsystems' proprietary outline
                font format)
            </li>
            <li>
                <samp>.pfa</samp> (Adobe Type 1 PostScript Font ASCII)
            </li>
            <li>
                <samp>.pfb</samp> (Adobe Type 1 PostScript Font Binary)
            </li>
            <li>
                <samp>.spd</samp> (Bitstream Speedo outline font format)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <samp>.snf</samp> format is considered obsoleted, having
            been replaced by the <samp>.pcf</samp> format; however, many
            of our local systems still use the <samp>.snf</samp> format.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outline fonts need to be rasterized into specific sizes;
            this may be done on-the-fly in the X server, or via a remote
            <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/X-Window-System-fonts.html#Font-servers">font server.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            More information on font formats can be found in the GNU
            Font Utilities documentation in the <samp>emacs info</samp>
            and <samp>xinfo</samp> systems.

            The utilities <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/dxfc.html"><samp>dxfc</samp></a>, <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/bdftopcf.html"><samp>bdftopcf</samp></a>
            and <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/bdftosnf.html"><samp>bdftosnf</samp></a>
            convert between some of these formats, but converters for
            several font file format combinations are lacking.
        </p>
        <p>
            <samp>getbdf</samp> can fetch a font from the X server,
            and output it in <samp>.bdf</samp> format.  Since there
            are converters from this format to the others, this
            utility makes it possible to convert between any pair of
            formats, albeit by a roundabout route through the X
            server.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/bdfresize.html"><samp>bdfresize</samp></a>
            can be used to scale a font in <samp>.bdf</samp> format by
            a rational factor.  The output is also a <samp>.bdf</samp>
            file, but before you can use it, you need to edit the FONT
            line in the output file to change the font name to reflect
            the altered size.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/showsnf.html"><samp>showsnf</samp></a>
            can be used to print the contents of an <samp>.snf</samp>
            file.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/mftobdf.html"><samp>mftobdf</samp></a>
            can be used to convert Metafont fonts to <samp>.bdf</samp>
            format.
        </p>
        <p>
            The
            <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/fstobdf.html"><samp>fstobdf</samp></a>
            utility can read any font from a font server, and output
            it in <samp>.bdf</samp> format
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/xfd.html"><samp>xfd</samp></a>
            utility displays a table of all characters in a font, for
            example, <samp>xfd -fn 10x20</samp>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/xlsfonts.html"><samp>xlsfonts</samp></a>
            utility lists all of the fonts known to the X server.  On
            many systems, this will produce a long list of 1000--2000
            fonts, so if you use it, you probably want to filter its
            output through a pager, like <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/less.html">
            <samp>less</samp></a>, <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/more.html"><samp>more</samp></a>, or <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/pg.html"><samp>pg</samp></a>, or else
            through a pattern search utility like <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/agrep.html"><samp>agrep</samp></a>, <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/cgrep.html"><samp>cgrep</samp></a>, <samp>

        </h2>
        <p>
            Fonts are found in a directory path established by the <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/xset.html"><samp>xset</samp></a> command,
            and once the directories have been established, it is
            necessary to run <samp>xset fp rehash</samp> to force the
            X server to read all of the directories and load up the
            names of fonts found in them:
        </p>
<pre>% xset fp+ /usr/local/share/lib/X11/fonts/European
% xset fp+ /usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/F3
% xset fp+ /usr/dt/config/xfonts
% xset fp rehash
</pre>
        <p>
            The <samp>fp+</samp> option adds the directory to the <em>
            end</em> of the current list, which was originally
            established by a command in your <samp>.xinitrc</samp> or
            <samp>.xsession</samp> file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <samp>fp+</samp> option adds the directory to the <em>
            end</em> If required, you can add a directory to the front
            of the search path by using <samp>+fp</samp> instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find out what the current font path is like this:

            Because most users will use only a rather small number of
            fonts, their font paths may be rather short.  Nevertheless,
            if you want to take advantage of additional fonts, you
            should be prepared to investigate the local offerings with
            suitable <samp>ls -F</samp> commands as shown above.

            Most computer users in the Western World are accustomed to
            the ASCII or ISO8859-1 Latin 1 character sets, which are
            standard on computer keyboards (except in the IBM mainframe
            world).  ISO8859-1 is the standard character set used in
            HTML, the document markup language used on the World-Wide
            Web.
        </p>
        <p>
            These character sets offer 128 or 256 characters, which is
            usually enough for languages such as English, French,
            German, Danish, ....  However, when the accented characters
            of the European languages are enumerated, then 256
            characters are insufficient, and consequently, there are
            several character set variants, sometimes called <em>code
            pages</em>, in the ISO8859 Standard which have common
            lower-128 character assignments, but differ in the upper
            128:

            Within the limitations of an 8-bit character set, there
            are a great many `code pages', that is, assignments of
            particular glyphs to entries in a 256-character table,
            with the glyph set chosen to be important for a particular

        <p>
            Chinese, Japanese, and Korean pose a much larger problem for
            font designers and font software, because each requires
            several thousand characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            The X Window System font file formats can support up to
            65,536 characters in a font, but not all font software works
            properly with these fonts.  In particular, on Sun
            Microsystems systems, <samp>/usr/openwin/bin/xfd</samp> will
            display only the first 256 characters in such a font.  You
            need to use <samp>/usr/local/X11R5/bin/xfd</samp> to view
            such fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until recently, vendor support of Asian language fonts was
            spotty, at least in the vendors of the systems normally sold
            in North America.  Fortunately, the Free Software Foundation
            has collected a large number of international fonts
            contributed by many individuals and companies around the
            world, and our local systems now have all of them available
            for use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sample listing above for the directory
            <samp>/usr/local/share/lib/X11/fonts/</samp> shows
            subdirectories containing fonts for Chinese, Japanese,
            Korean, ISO-8859-n European, Asian (Devanagiri, Lao,
            Tibetan, and Thai), Arabic, and Hebrew.  Some of these are
            still incomplete (notably, Devanagiri), and there is still
            no coverage of the scripts required by most the major
            languages of India, nor of Persian and Urdu, nor of any of
            the south-central Asian languages, such as Georgian.

        <p>
            Fonts in the X Window System have long descriptive names,
            but such names are often inconvenient to type, so provisions
            are made for aliases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each X11 font directory contains one or two additional files
            beside the font files: <samp>fonts.dir</samp> and
            <samp>fonts.alias</samp>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <samp>fonts.dir</samp> file is created by the <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/mkfontdir.html"><samp>mkfontdir</samp></a>
            utility, which reads all of the font files in the
            directory and extracts their long names.  A typical file
            looks like this:
        </p>
<pre>% cd /usr/local/share/lib/X11/fonts/Asian
% head -5 fonts.dir

mule-indian-24.pcf -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--24-240-72-72-c-120-muleindian-2

thai-24.pcf -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--24-240-72-72-c-120-tis620.2529-1
</pre>
        <p>
            The first line contains a font count, and the remaining
            lines consist of a file name, and a long font name.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <samp>fonts.alias</samp> file is created by a human, and
            consists of lines with a short name and a full name, for
            example:
        </p>
<pre>% cd /usr/local/share/lib/X11/fonts
% cat fonts.alias
a14 -ETL-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--14-140-72-72-C-70-ISO8859-1
a16 -ETL-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--16-160-72-72-C-80-ISO8859-1
a24 -ETL-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--24-240-72-72-C-120-ISO8859-1
</pre>
        <p>
            Thus, you should use the second of these fonts in an X
            terminal session like this:
        </p>
<pre>% xterm -fn a14 &amp;
</pre>
        or like this:
<pre>% xterm -fn -ETL-Fixed-Medium-R-Normal--14-140-72-72-C-70-ISO8859-1 &amp;
</pre>
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can switch to such a font in an X
            terminal selection by getting the font name into the X
            selection buffer (e.g. by a copy operation in the <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/emacs.html"><samp>emacs</samp></a> text
            editor, or in an <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/fonts/manpages/xfontsel.html"><samp>xfontsel</samp></a>
            window), then using Ctrl-Right-MouseButton to popup the
            <em> VT Fonts</em> menu, and from it select the last item,
            labelled <em>Selection </em>.  This can be convenient if
            you need to temporarily switch fonts, such as to read an
            e-mail message in a different character set.

        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to address some of the deficiencies of font
            handling in the X Window System, among them the need to
            propagate many megabytes of font files to each client
            system, and to rasterize outline fonts into bitmap fonts
            on-the-fly, X11R5 introduced the idea of <em>font
            servers</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            While font servers may indeed work adequately at sites with
            all machines purchased from a single UNIX vendor, the
            experience at our site, which has more than a hundred
            workstations representing 5 vendors, 8 operating systems,
            and dozens of hardware models, is that font servers tend to
            cause hard-to-debug hangs of client systems, and therefore,
            we choose not to run them.  Instead, we simply provide the
            font files in a common NFS-mounted directory that is
            accessible to all of our systems.  This avoids file space
            replication, and greatly facilitates maintenance and update
            of the font collection.

        </h2>
        <p>
            The X server, which is responsible for rendering fonts,
            normally runs as the root user, rather than as the
            logged-in user.  In most cases, this is transparent to the
            human user.  However, if there are directories in the font
            path which reside on another system, and those
            directories, or files in them, lack world read access,
            then the X server will not be able to read them, <em>even
            if the human user can</em>.

            X terminals are low-cost workstations that run a simplified
            UNIX-like operating system that is just sufficient to
            support running an X server, but no user processes.
            X terminals usually have no disks, and therefore, no file
            system.
        </p>
        <p>
            X terminals may be configured so that the user automatically
            logs in on a specific remote system, or they may be
            configured to offer a menu of assorted remote hosts that the
            user can select from before logging in.
        </p>
        <p>
            X terminals store a very small set of fonts in read-only
            nonvolatile memory, and then when they are powered on, or
            rebooted, they fetch their operating system and other
            needed fonts from a remote server machine.  Because they
            do not have user accounts on the remote server, there is
            no password authentication possible, so they get their
            data via TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol), or via a
            mount of a memory-mapped read-only NFS (Network File
            System) tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            For both TFTP and NFS access, remote servers drastically
            limit the part of the file system that the X terminals can
            see, usually just to a small file directory tree provided
            by the X terminal vendor.  For security reasons, this tree
            does not permit symbolic links to other files or
            directories outside the tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            This practice has a <em>significant</em> impact on users who
            want to use additional X11 fonts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Since the only files the X terminal can see are those in
                its remote TFTP tree, unless local system management has
                copied the normal X11 fonts into that tree, the X
                terminal user will not be able to access them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users who have private collections of X11 fonts will be
                entirely unable to access them from an X terminal,
                whereas they could do so without problems from an ordinary
                UNIX workstation.
            </li>
            <li>
                If your site has X terminals from multiple vendors, then
                their TFTP trees and thus, font collections, will
                differ.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the second case, your only recourse is to ask your system
            management to add your personal X11 font collection to the X
            terminal TFTP trees.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I login to a local X terminal (an HDS ViewStation) and
            run <samp>xset q</samp>, here is what I get for a font path:
        </p>
<pre>% xset q
...
Font Path:
        /builtin/,
        /hds/fonts/100dpi/,
        /hds/fonts/75dpi/,
        /hds/fonts/Asterx2.1/,
        /hds/fonts/Asterx3.0/,
        /hds/fonts/Xol/,
        /hds/fonts/lotus123/,
        /hds/fonts/misc/,
        /hds/fonts/softpc/,
        /hds/fonts/wp5.1/,
        /hds/fonts/international/,
        /hds/fonts/tn/,
        /hds/local/fonts/decwin/100dpi/,
        /hds/local/fonts/decwin/75dpi/
</pre>
        <p>
            The path <samp>/hds</samp> represents the root of the TFTP
            tree, which actually corresponds to the UNIX file path
            <samp>/export/local/netOS/2.0.2</samp> on a local file
            server.
        </p><p>

        </p><p>
            To solve these problems, at the University of Utah Center
            for Scientific Computing facilities in the Mathematics
            Department, we are making rearrangements in the NCD and
            HDS/Neoware X terminal TFTP trees, and the normal shared X11
            font tree, <samp>/usr/local/share/lib/X11/fonts</samp>, to
            ensure that the same set of fonts is available in all of
            them.  However, as of the time of writing this
            [21-Nov-1997], the work is still in progress.

AIXwindows SNF Font Utilities withdrawn

The SNF (Server Natural Format - compiled X Window font file format)
utilities bdftosnf, showsnf, pcfsnfdir, and pcftobdf will not be
available on AIX Version 4.1. There are no requirements for SNF font
support in the AIXwindows environment on AIX Version 4.1. The AIXwindows
fonts will be shipped in the PCF (Portable Compiled Font Format -
compiled X font file format).

NB: I could not find these on a local AIX 3.2 system:

         which bdftosnf showsnf pcfsnfdir pcftobdf
        bdftosnf: Command not found.
        showsnf: Command not found.
        pcfsnfdir: Command not found.
        pcftobdf: Command not found.

Nor were they in the /usr/lpp/X11 tree.
