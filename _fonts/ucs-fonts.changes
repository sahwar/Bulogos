Changed back U+2018 to U+2019 to the original design. The attempt
to preserve the style of the original U+0027 APOSTROPHE (a compromise
between acute and curly quotation mark) turned out to be too ugly,
especially for the reverse comma and double quotation marks.

Baseline lowered by one pixel, to provide more space for accents
such that uppercase characters do not have to be reduced for putting
accents onto them. Most accented characters still have to be
adapted. Combining characters (U+03xx) should serve as template of
how accents should look like consistently.

Birger Langkjer <birger.langkjer@image.dk>:
I've fixed 9x18 armenian in the same style as helvR12. I tried to
follow Robert Brady's design ideas and removed a lot of serifs and made
the glyphs a little wider instead. I made u+0555 'OH' extra wide to
distinguish it from the '0'.
These changes can be cut'n'pasted into 9x15, no changes are necessary, I
think.

Reversed Robert's change to the B (has now serifs again to make it
clearly distinguishable from the 8), and made the D rounder to clearly
distinguish it from the O (inspired by OCR-B).

Fixes to Greek Extended by Birger Langkjer <birger.langkjer@image.dk>:

1fdd and 1fde was facing the wrong way.

I lowered the accents on 1f70-1f7d, 1fb1-ffb2, 1fb4, 1fc2, 1fc4, 1fd1, 1fe1,
1ff2 and 1ff4 to make consistency in the font.

I raised 1fb9, 1fd9 and 1fe9 one pixel, because I thought it looked better that
way. It's also more consistent with 0100, 0102 etc.

Changes suggested by Constantine Stathopoulos <cstath@irismedia.gr>:
0387 - GREEK ANO TELEIA: should begin at the same height with the
                         small letters
03d7 - GREEK KAI SYMBOL: needs its accent reversed (it should have
                         a varia/grave instead of an oxia/acute)
(Note: the U+03D7 glyph in FPDAM ISO 10646-1/Amd. 30 on
Michael Eversons <http://www.indigo.ie/egt/standards/iso10646/pdf/>
website does not have any accent at all!)

Roozbeh Pournader <roozbeh@sharif.edu> and Behdad Esfahbod have
redrawn almost all of the existing Arabic glyphs to both go with the other

U+06xx and U+FExx blocks are complete, U+FB50..U+FDFF includes
everything that may have a use in single-width.
