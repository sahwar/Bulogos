      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      
      <p>
       This is a selective guide to <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>-based 
       fonts and script projects that are ideal for free/libre/open source (FLOSS) 
       operating systems like GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.  As a general policy, I include here only 
       fonts that:
      </p>

      <ul>
       <li> Contain Unicode CMAPs for mapping Unicode values to glyphs.</li>
       <li> Can be downloaded and used legally for free.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
       Preference is given to high-quality vector fonts that have been released under  
       SIL International's <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL">Open Font License (OFL)</a>, the
       Free Software Foundation's <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>, and
       similarly open licenses.  I also include other important Unicode fonts, including a few notable shareware fonts where the authors request payment of a fee after an initial free evaluation.  Although
       this document focuses on vector fonts that work well on free operating systems, these fonts 
       will also work well on Unicode-capable Windows operating systems (Windows 2000 and XP)
       and on Apple OSX.
      </p>
    
      <p>
       Please note that other, more extensive online font guides do exist. In particular
       Alan Wood's <a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fonts.html">Unicode fonts for
       Windows computers</a> is an extensive resource which covers commercial, shareware, and
       free fonts.  In contrast to Mr. Wood's site, I have focused on Open Source, non-governmental
       organization (NGO), and government-sponsored font and script initiatives that aim to facilitate
       computing in national and indigenous languages throughout the world.
      </p>
 
      <p>
       Some of the included font projects provide numerous fonts.  In these cases, I have also tried to 
       include images of a representative sample of the available fonts.
       For many of the sample font images, I have used the first article of the
       <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/navigate/alpha.htm">
        United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
       </a> which has been translated into hundreds of languages.
       If you want to compare translations of just the first article, 
       try Xavier Nègre's excellent 
       <a href="http://www.lexilogos.com/declaration_article_premier.htm">déclaration universelle
       des droits de l'homme</a> page at <a href="http://www.lexilogos.com/">www.lexilogos.com</a>.
     </p>
     
     <p>
      Instructions on installing these fonts on GNU/Linux and similar free operating systems are provided on
      our <a href="https://unifont.org/index.html">main Unicode page</a>.  Note that many fonts are packaged in <code>.zip</code>
      files for the convenience of Windows users.  Under free Unices, just use the <code>unzip</code> utility
      from your terminal.  Some fonts are packaged in self-extracting <code>.exe</code> packages for Windows.
      Here again you can simply use the <code>unzip</code> utility since the <code>.exe</code> basically consists
      of a short executable stub with the zipped font files attached to it.
     </p>
   
     <h2>DownloadFonts.sh: A Convenient Tool for the Impatient</h2>
 
     <p>
      If today you are feeling impatient and wish that you could just download <em>all</em> the fonts referenced on this
      site while blithely sipping your coffee or tea -- well now you can <em>almost</em> do just that by using  
      <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/downloads/DownloadFonts.sh">this simple DownloadFonts.sh shell script</a>.  The script will 
      download a large set of the very best FLOSS international fonts referenced on this site.  The script requires that you have
      the <code>wget</code>, <code>tar</code>, and <code>unzip</code> utilities, as well as the <code>fontforge</code>
      font editor.  The script will download font files to a <code>fonts</code> subdirectory under the current working 
      directory.
     </p>

     <p>
      The shell script has been recently revised by Dugan Chen and now supports resuming downloads after broken sessions.
      Thanks, Dugan!  Go ahead and give it a try -- this is by far the fastest way to gather the best international 
      FLOSS fonts from
      all across the planet.
     </p>

     <h2>Thanks</h2>

     <p>
      As time has gone on and this site has become increasingly popular, more and more people have
      contributed by suggesting new fonts, updating me on changed links, or informing me of fonts that
      have switched over to SIL's new OFL license.
      Thanks to everyone for helping to keep this site up-to-date with current information!
     </p>
     <p>
      I would also like to thank Ritu Khanna and Monisha Sharma for their generous help with testing 
      and preparing the Indic font samples which appear in the <b>South Asian</b> section
      of this guide.  Dugan Chen also deserves special mention for taking my half-baked shell script
      for downloading fonts and turning it into something more useful.  
     </p>

     <h2>Work In Progress ... </h2>

     <p>
      This page is under a state of constant construction, especially due to the fact that
      recently there has been more and more Open Source font activity.  
      <b>Please continue to send me news and information about new Open Source font releases
      that are of interest to the Open Source development and user communities at large</b>.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also note that these pages still have some gaps, especially for minority scripts which
      have only recently been added into Unicode.
      In some cases, I have
      not yet had time to research a script thoroughly.  In other cases, I have researched
      a script, but not yet found any GPL'ed or otherwise liberally licensed fonts for that
      script. 
      <b>Additional information to help fill in the gaps will be greatly appreciated</b>.
     </p>

     <!-- PAN UNICODE -->
     <h1>Pan-Unicode Fonts</h1>
     
     <p>
      Pan-Unicode fonts are large fonts that cover a significant number of script blocks
      defined by the Unicode standard.  Pan-Unicode fonts are useful if you occasionally work with
      other languages and don't feel like installing a large number of script-specific fonts.
     </p>
     <p>
      One disadvantage of pan-Unicode fonts are that glyphs from different scripts
      are often not aesthetically integrated across script blocks. Secondly, since it is nearly impossible
      for one or a few font designers to have been thoroughly schooled in the typographic traditions
      of numerous cultures and nations, glyphs in some of the script blocks may 
      be of lower technical or aesthetic quality than glyphs in other script blocks.  
      Finally, differences in national typographic traditions can lead to situations where glyphs which
      are adequate in one country appear odd or inappropriate in another country.  For example,
      glyphs that are ideal for writing Arabic in Egypt are very likely not ideal for writing
      Urdu in Pakistan, even though both languages share the same basic alphabet.  Similarly, even though the 
      assignment of code points for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters of Chinese origin has
      been unified in Unicode, the glyph forms of Japanese Kanji may be inappropriate for
      writing Chinese in Mainland China, and vice-versa.  For these reasons, if you use a certain subset of scripts 
      or national script variants frequently, it is better in the long run to obtain fonts designed to cover 
      those scripts or national variants specifically.  <b>Take a look at the 

      tabbed pages that follow to find various script-specific or region-specific fonts</b>.
     </p>

     <h2>Why We Don't Really Need Pan-Unicode Fonts Anymore</h2>

     <p>
      Several factors have emerged in recent years which, in my mind, have greatly reduced
      the perceived necessity and utility of the Pan-Unicode fonts.
     </p>
     <p>
      First,
      an increasing number of free and liberally-licensed Unicode fonts of very high
      quality for specific scripts and specific uses (such as scholarly) have 
      been released by dedicated groups and individuals.  The existence of George Williams'
      Open Source <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">FontForge</a> outline font editor
      has certainly played an important role in the <em>democratization</em> of typography.
      One need only take a cursory look at some of the excellent
      work being done by a diverse spectrum of organizations
      --like <a href="http://www.sil.org/">SIL International</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.thdl.org/">The Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Digital Library</a>,
      or the <a href="http://www.khmeros.info/">Khmer Software Initiative</a>-- and individual people --like 
      Christopher Harvey's work on fonts for native American languages at  
      <a href="http://www.languagegeek.com/">LanguageGeek.com</a>,
      Paul Morrow's work on Babayin at <a href="http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/">Sarisari Filipino History</a>,
      or <a href="http://www.study-area.org/">Firefly</a> and 
      <a href="http://wqy.sourceforge.net/">Qianqian Fang</a>'s contributions to 
      Open Source Chinese fonts--
      to realize how true this is.
     </p>
     <p>
      Secondly, the flexibility of Keith Packard's 
      <a href="http://fontconfig.org/">Fontconfig</a> library allows the construction
      via simple XML-based configuration files of virtual font sets 
      (such as "sans" and "serif") which can do a better job than any one Pan-Unicode font can
      at covering the Unicode
      code space with high-quality glyphs coming out of projects such as those highlighted
      in the previous paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      We have now arrived at a historic turning-point in the evolution of Open Source 
      digital typography and, in the broader context, of Open Source systems in general.  
      The (typographically-inclined) salamanders have emerged from the depauperate
      Jurassic morass and, inspired by the fresh possibilities of a new era, a diverse 
      Creataceous flowering of free, high-quality fonts is emerging to fill every niche
      and ecosystem.
     </p>
 
     <p>
      Pan-Unicode fonts may still be useful as fall-back fonts of last resort, 
      but clearly their role in any kind of high-quality typographic endeavour 
      is now much reduced.
     </p>

     <h2>GNU FreeFont Project
      <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/fontlicenses/gpl.txt"><img class="icon" src="./Unicode Font Guide For Free_Libre Open Source Operating Systems_files/gpl.png" alt="GPL"></a>  
     </h2>
 
     <p>
      The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/">GNU FreeFont</a> project provides
      serif, sans-serif, and mono-spaced Unicode OpenType typefaces originally descended from the 
      old URW++ Nimbus typefaces.  The project has now added numerous scripts and symbol blocks
      primarily by borrowing glyphs from other freely licensed fonts <i>en masse</i>. 
      Script coverage includes the International Phonetic Alphabet, Braille, 
      Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, 
      Thaana, Syriac, Ethiopian, Armenian, Georgian, Devanagari, Bengali, Gujarati, 
      Gurmukhi, Sinhala, Tamil, Malayalam, Mongolian, Tai Le, Thai, Cherokee, 
      Hanunóo, Buginese, Coptic, Gothic, Ugaritic, Old Persian, Phoenician, Runic.
      Symbol coverage includes Mathematical Operators, Geometrical shapes, 
      Diacritical marks, Western music, and Byzantine music, <i>inter alia</i>.
     </p>

     <h2>Bitstream Cyberbit</h2>
     
     <p>
      <a href="ftp://ftp8.netscape.com/pub/communicator/extras/fonts/windows/">Bitstream Cyberbit</a> is a 
      professionally-designed large Unicode font which provides coverage of many major scripts, 
      including Latin, extended Latin, Greek, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai, Japanese (Hiragana, 
      Katakana, and Kanji), Korean, and Chinese Hanzi (ideographs). Among TrueType fonts with extensive Unicode 
      coverage, this font has historically been one of the best that could be downloaded for free.  The
      <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/fontlicenses/BitstreamCyberbitLicense.txt">Bitstream Cyberbit Font License</a> permits the
      licensee to use the font for free on only one system. 
     </p>
     
     <img src="./Unicode Font Guide For Free_Libre Open Source Operating Systems_files/cyberbit_sm.png" alt="Bitstream Cyberbit Font Sample">
     
     <p>
      Not recommended for Thai. Although the font contains a full set of Thai glyphs, 
      the positioning of vowel and tone marks, while readable in most cases, is not always typographically 
      correct.
     </p>
     
     <h2>Code 2000 and Code 2001</h2>
     <p>
      <a href="http://home.att.net/~jameskass/code2000_page.htm">Code 2000</a> is an experimental shareware font with over 
      34,000 glyphs designed by 
      <a href="http://home.att.net/~jameskass/">James Kass</a> to cover all of the non-Han sections of the Unicode 
      Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). 
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking carefully at the glyphs in this font, it is evident that Mr. Kass' objective has been to 
      cover as much of the BMP as possible (rather than to design a beautiful font). 
      He has certainly achieved this objective, as this is one of the few fonts available with extensive 
      coverage of many scripts, including scripts only recently added into the Unicode standard
      for which fonts are difficult to find or not yet available elsewhere, 
      such as Canadian Syllabics, Limbu, and Buginese.  Code 2000 has OpenType tables for some but not all of
      the Indic and other complex text layout (CTL) scripts for which glyphs are present in the font.  Code 2000
      is therefore not a general solution for Indic and CTL scripts, but may be useful in creating Unicode
      charts where only isolated forms of CTL script characters are required. 
      The shareware fee for continued use of this font after evaluation is <b>$US 5.00</b>.<sup>†</sup>

      The type designer and linguist <a href="http://www.evertype.com/misc/bio.html">Michael Everson</a> 
      has been extremely active in the development of the Unicode Standard.  He has contributed more proposals
      for encoding of the world's scripts in Unicode than anyone else.  His 
      <a href="http://www.evertype.com/emono/">Everson Mono Unicode</a> font covers many of the non-Han
      script blocks in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646-1, including Latin, extended Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Armenian, Georgian, and
      even Cherokee and the Unified Canadian Syllabics.  Originally available only for Macintosh, the font is
      now finally available to PC users as well.

       <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/fontlicenses/apl.txt"><img alt="Arphic Font License" src="./Unicode Font Guide For Free_Libre Open Source Operating Systems_files/afl.png" class="icon"></a>
       font is a truetype font with embedded screen-optimized bitmap 
       glyphs (點陣字) for every size from 11 to 16 pixels.  The font was created by
       merging the Arphic traditional and simplified truetype glyph sets and
       then creating bitmap glyphs for the smaller sizes. 
       CJK fonts are notoriously hard to hint, and
       antialiased Chinese fonts are usually too blurred to read on screen 
       in small pixel sizes.  Embedding bitmap glyphs into a truetype font
       is a well-known solution, but the task of creating nearly 100,000
       bitmap glyphs to cover the required pixel sizes is enormous.  
       Fortunately, the long-awaited solution has now been realized by
       Firefly (螢火飛) who also has contributed many 
       <a href="http://firefly.idv.tw/setfont-xft/patches/">patches to solve CJK GNU/Linux
       display problems</a>.  The bitmaps created by Firefly have been released
       under the GPL while the Arphic vector glyphs are released under the Arphic

       insufficient "hinting" of anti-aliased Chinese fonts.
       For the 12pt font, Hangul glyphs (U+AC00~U+D7A3) from GNU Unifont 
       (Roman Czyborra/David Starner et al.) were used for bold
       face while those from Hanterm 3.x

       The release of this font is dedicated to Wang Hong for her extraordinary contribution to 
       the Wen Quan Yi Project.  The font builds
       upon previous work by Firefly, RedFlag Linux, as well as contributions from

       <b>cwTeX</b> is a Chinese-capable TeX distribution by Tsong-Min Wu and
       Tsong-Huey Wu.  
       Several Chinese Type 1 PostScript fonts are distributed along with
       cwTeX. In the last year, Edward G.J. Lee converted five of the included 
       typefaces into the TrueType format, combined these with the CM fonts for
       the LGC script, and with the UnFonts for Japanese and Korean.
       These <a href="http://cle.linux.org.tw/fonts/cwttf/">cwTeX TrueType fonts</a> 
       <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/fontlicenses/gpl.txt"><img class="icon" src="./Unicode Font Guide For Free_Libre Open Source Operating Systems_files/gpl.png" alt="GNU General Public License"></a>  
       are released under the GPL. The fonts
       feature five of the most commonly used typefaces in Chinese. 
       Among these, the included MingTi （明體） font contains glyphs conforming to 
       Chinese typographic conventions and is thus useful for 
       for printed documents.
       See <a href="http://bs2.twbbs.org/blog/post/EdwardLee/816">Edward G.J. Lee's blog</a>

       relatively more calligraphic （書（手）寫體） glyph styles among Chinese fonts.

<p>
On Linux, support for Tibetan fonts has been present in KDE/QT applications for a long time.  
Support for Tibetan became available to Gnome/GTK+ applications with the release of Pango 
version 1.17.1 in May, 2006.  Everything should therefore work very well in recent Linux 
distributions such as <a href="http://dzongkha.sourceforge.net/">Dzongkha Linux</a>.  
If you are using an older distribution of linux, upgrading Pango to version 1.17.1 may be
necessary. 
</p>
<p>
 Limitations to using Tibetan fonts on Mac OSX (including 10.5) continue to exist 
 as the OpenType support does not seem to cover all the features used by Tibetan fonts, 
 but it apparently works in some Mac applications which implement their own OT support.
</p>
<p>
 When using Tibetan fonts on recent Windows operating systems prior to Vista, 
 be sure to install a version of Uniscribe which has support for Tibetan, or else 
 use the Uniscribe dynamic link library (dll) which comes with Office 2003.

       Paul Morrow has produced a set of <a href="http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/fonts.htm">five Baybayin fonts</a> 
       which can be downloaded from his very informative English/Tagalog web site on
       <a href="http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/">Philippine history, language, and culture</a>.  Four of Morrow's five
       fonts are based closely on historical typefaces used to print early Philippine books, such as the <b>Doctrina Christiana</b>
       of 1593, while the fifth represents a modern confluence of the historical calligraphic forms.  The Windows TrueType versions
       of these fonts are Unicode-compliant.

       <a href="http://youpibouh.thefreecat.org/download/tagbanwa.htm">Tagbanwa font</a>

      <h2>Tai Le</h2>

      <p>
       <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/">SIL International</a> has released a New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai 西雙版納傣, ไทลื้อ) font,
       <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=DaiBannaSIL">Dai Banna SIL</a>
       under SIL's

       <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/fontlicenses/ofl.txt"><img class="icon" src="./Unicode Font Guide For Free_Libre Open Source Operating Systems_files/ofl.png" alt="OFL"></a>.
       This font is now a unicode font. It has complete
       coverage of the New Tai Lue script block plus an extra symbol in the PUA
       that SIL believes needs to be added to unicode. The font contains graphite tables
       required for proper vowel reordering.
       (Note that Graphite integration into OpenOffice 2.3 is forthcoming).  Support for
       OpenType is possible, but as of this writing (2007.12.14), no OpenType shapers are
       known to exist for the Tai Le script.

       Darien Valentine crafted a pleasing Unicode font for Tai Le
       called <a href="http://www.wazu.jp/downloads/taileval.zip">
       Tai Le Valentinium</a>.  On his web site, the author of this font previously stated,
       "This is, quite simply, the best font I have ever created."  
       Unfortunately, the author's web site, <b>fixedsys.org</b> is no longer available.
       However, this font can still be obtained from <b>WAZU JAPAN's Gallery of Unicode Fonts</b> at
       <a href="http://www.wazu.jp/downloads/taileval.zip">this address</a>.

      <p>
        The <b>Thai National Electronics and Computer Technology Center</b> 
        (<a href="http://www.nectec.or.th/"><b>NECTEC</b> 
        ศูนย์เทคโนโลยีอิเล็กทรอนิกส์และคอมพิวเตอร์แห่งชาติ</a>) provides a set of high-quality
        national fonts released under the GPL.  
        Stacked vowels and especially the tone marks like U+0E48 MAI EK (◌่) and 
        U+0E49 MAI THO (◌้) are placed correctly in these fonts 
        (this is not the case in the pan-Unicode <b>Bitstream Cyberbit</b> font).
        The national fonts include <b>Garuda</b>, <b>Kinnari</b>,
        and <b>Norasi</b>. <b>Loma</b> is a newer font also distributed under the GPL
        that is quite good for web browsers and other online viewing applications.  
        NECTEC does not appear to provide an online distribution center themselves.  Instead, try
        the <a href="http://linux.thai.net/plone/TLWG/thaifonts_scalable/">ThaiFonts-Scalable</a>
        project which serves as a repository that collects all available free Thai fonts.
        According to <a href="http://linux.thai.net/~thep/">Theppitak Karoonboonyanan</a>, this
        site should have the most up-to-date versions of these and other fonts.

<h2>Vietnamese</h2>

<p>
 <a href="http://www.vn.net/">VN.net</a> hosts a
 a group of “designed-for-Vietnamese” Unicode fonts.  These fonts have proper diacritic
 positioning and the increased linespacing required for readable Vietnamese typography.
 Fonts which are currently available on the site include the
 <a href="http://www.vn.net/staticpages/index.php/VietUniFont-TriChlorSet">Tri-Chlor set</a>,
 and the <a href="http://www.vn.net/staticpages/index.php/VietUniFont-WebSet1">Web Fonts set</a>.
 These font sets feature the 134 Vietnamese glyphs (ký tự Việt trong Unicode) and additional
 38 Pali-Sanskrit Glyphs (ký tự Phạn Pali-Sanskrit trong Unicode) required by the Unicode Standard.
 Float marks, the euro and Vietnamese đồng currency symbols, and the Buddhist wheels, U+ee80 and U+ee81,
 are also included.
</p>

<p>
 For writing the ancient Chinese-based writing system, vn.net hosts the
 <a href="http://www.vn.net/staticpages/index.php/VietUniFont-HanNomSet">Han Nom font set</a>
 developed by Chan Nguyen Do Quoc Bao, To Minh Tam, and
 Ni sinh Thien Vien Vien Chieu.

<p>
 Bhikkhu Pesala, an English Buddhist monk at the
 <a href="http://www.aimwell.org/">Association for Insight Meditation</a>
 has created a derivative of the Bitstream Vera fonts called
 <a href="http://www.aimwell.org/Fonts/fonts.html">Verajja</a>
 <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/fontlicenses/bvfl.txt"><img src="./Unicode Font Guide For Free_Libre Open Source Operating Systems_files/bvfl.png" class="icon" alt="Bitstream Vera Font License"></a>.
 “Verajja” is a Pāli word meaning “a variety of kingdoms or provinces,”
 and the font contains all of the characters required for Pali, Vietnamese,
 and many other languages.  The font has been recently updated to provide
 better support for Vietnamese.
</p>

<p>
 Štěpán Roh integrated a number of the
 Verajja glyphs into the better-publicised Bitstream Vera derivative known as
 <a href="http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">DejaVu</a>
 <a href="https://unifont.org/fontguide/fontlicenses/bvfl.txt"><img src="./Unicode Font Guide For Free_Libre Open Source Operating Systems_files/bvfl.png" class="icon" alt="Bitstream Vera Font License"></a>.
 However, I am not sure if the more recent improvements in the positioning of Vietnamese
 diacritics in the latest versions of Verajja are also going to be incorporated into DejaVu or not.
</p>

<p>
 Clytie Siddall of the Vietnamese free-software translation team (nhóm
 Việt hóa phần mềm tự do) has an excellent treatise
 <a href="http://www.riverland.net.au/~clytie/viet/fonts.html">comparing Unicode fonts for Vietnamese</a>
 in which she highlights the vn.net typographer Hùng's
 <a href="http://www.riverland.net.au/~clytie/viet/font_images/vu_phu_tho.html">Vu Phu Tho</a> font
 as an example of how Vietnamese diacritics should look.  Although this font is not currently available on
 the vn.net site, we are encouraging the author to put it up on the site again.

       and print formats. 
       The STIX fonts project currently has 8,041 glyphs and is currently undergoing
       a thorough review.  According to the project,
       "<i>The new anticipated date for the beta test to begin is late October (2006).

       first production release, which is still scheduled to occur 
       before the end of December 2006.</i>"  It sounds like they want to release it in time
       to catch at least a little bit of the Christmas market ...
