**WARNING:** This is just some hardware that I have used, it is NOT intended to
be an advertisement of said hardware products! I am just sharing what I could
get my hands on to use, that's all! I am certain that there are other, also
very good-quality hardware products out there! Do your own online research & ask
around before buying some hardware product and I hope it serves you well for many
years if it is of a good make! (But do realize that everything is always YinYang
so there is no such thing as a perfect/flawless product; each has some expiration
date or just falls apart or malfunctions after many years/etc. Which is NORMAL.
So make sure to do REGULAR BACKUPS of your MOST IMPORTANT PERSONAL DATA to some
other new external data-storage media (e.g. new HDDs/SSDs/tape drives/whatever
you can make do, even some CDs/DVDs that last ~5 years if well kept under proper
conditions). Also check out http://reddit.com/r/datahoarder for information about
people who are obsessed with storing data for LONG-TERM!!!

## Desktops & laptops:

0. My first PC was so old that I don't remember any of its specs; it might even 
be the same as my 2nd PC but I just forgot...

1. my second PC was a novelty in my neighbourhood in Plovdiv, Bulgaria; I am not
 sure of the exact specification,
but it was probably some P3/P4 (Pentium III/IV) CPU with 1-3 eye-killing CRT 
display monitors; it ran Microsoft Windows 98 (32-bit), later
upgraded to MS Windows XP SP3 (32-bit)

2. Then I got a new PC that is a single-core AMD Athlon XP 3000 CPU; it ran a 
Microsoft Windows XP SP3

3. My last desktop PC was one bought from Multirama BG (before it went out of 
business) and had a nVidia GeForce 8800 GPU (later replaced by a nVidia GeForce 
9800GT), 4 GB of RAM DDR2 (or DDR3? I forgot...), and a 4-core Intel Core2 Quad 
Q6600 CPU (but the CPU fan got really mossy and I should put a better CPU fan & 
much better GPU fan; it also got its Network Card (Etherner/RJ45) replaced once 
and it got some Chinese-brand TV-tuner card that I never really used to record 
anything from connecting it to a TV because it used some lame Chinese-made 
proprietary app for MS Windows-only... It first ran a MS Windows XP SP3, I later
 upgraded it to MS Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit) and then to Microsoft 
 Windows 10 Insider, but then I downgraded it back to MS Windows 7 because at 
 that time, MS Windows 10 was fucking too unstable... as of February, 2020, 
 MS Windows 10 Pro (64-bit) is way more stable and with a ClassicShell-like app,
  it mostly usable but it still has some nasty BSODs due to the automatic 
  updates & some broken compatibility with apps for older versions of 
  MS Windows (Windows 7 had the excellent Anniversary Update, and 
  Platform Update packs, as well as the MS Windows XP-like emulator built-in 
  Compatibility Mode emulation layer that enabled you to set an app to run with
  best-compatibility ranging from MS Windows 95 all the way to MS Windows 7...

4. Acer Aspire 5745G (my current main laptop, made in 2010! It is now 2020 and 
it still works mostly fine, only the HDD had to be replaced after an HDD 
hardware failure... and the casing of the laptop's display is starting to fall 
apart at the edges...)!): 15.6" 16:9 HD LCD (1366x768px), nVidia GeForce GT330M 
1024MB VRAM, 4 GB RAM, 500/640/950 GB 2.5" HDD, CD/DVD reader/recorder, 
Bluetooth v2.1+EDR, Multi-in-1 card reader, 6-cell Li-ion battery (BatteryBar 
v3.6.6 Free Edition says that it has 29797 MWh and lasts for 1:12h after 10 
years of use (I may have replaced the battery at least once with a newer one...)
... the battery degradation is reported as 37,3% of 47520 MWh...)

5. At one point, I owned a sturdy Lenovo X60s laptop; therefore, I recommend 
FSF.org RYF-approved refurbished ThinkPad's, especially ThinkPad X200T, ThinkPad
 X201T, ThinkPad X220T (!), ThinkPad X230T, and ThinkPad T400, T420, T440, W500,
  W520 (!), W530, etc. (AS LONG as they are in a A/A-/B+ condition as 2nd-hand 
  PCs and you put a large (500GB-1TB+) HDD-or-SSD, and you may wish to buy a 
  new backup battery from aliexpress.com (the Chinese...) and an original 
  ThinkPad expansion dock for your particular model...).

(6. I never owned any of these laptops but most people recommend them: 
Dell XPS 16/17, the latest IPS-screen gaming Dell laptops & desktop PCs,
Microsoft Surface Pro 2+ + stylus, etc.)

## Smartphones, phablets, tablets, graphics tablets:

I have used several smartphones, phablets, tablets, owned by other people, but 
I only ever owned the following (most of them were bought for me by my generous 
relatives):

* Alcatel OneTouch Pixi (lame smartphone bought 2nd-hand for under 25 BGN, but 
it is useful in being very small/portable, like a bigger dumbphone; it was only 
useful for posting on Twitter.com and web-browsing, and storing some files; it 
is useless without an external SD-card for more storage; sadly, it lacked GPS 
so you had to download offline areas via Google Maps app that go into 
100MB-to-several-GiBs/GBs...)

* Allview AX4 Nano Plus 1024x600px tablet (2-core Cortex-A7 CPU @ 1.3GHz, 
512MB DDR3 RAM, 8GB ROM internal NandFlash memory, GPS & A-GPS, Bluetooth V.4, 
FM Radio, Google Android® 4.4.2 KitKat™ (поддържа български) OS, 
Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 b/g/n, microUSB 2.0 + USBv2.0 cable, short-lasting 
Li-Polymer 2500mAh battery (sadly, non-removable; I hate that newer smartphones
are ONLY with non-removable batteries...)

* Lenovo Motorola g(6) 64GB-memory - my current smartphone, it is stock 
Google Android (v8, later updated to v9; Google Android is usable only from 
v4.4.2 and especially starting with v7 - Google Android v7-v9 is the best 
Google Android before Android M & the newest FuchsiaOS/desktop-like 
ChromeOS/desktop-like Google Android v10+), but I considered putting 
CyanogenMod or LineageOS inside, but it is an excellent smartphone for its 
medium-range price, only the battery gets depleted in just under 1 day after
extremely heavy web-browser use...

* at one point, I bought a very well-preserved & fully-working 
Wacom 6x8" Intuos 3 USB Graphics Tablet Model PTZ-630 graphics tablet from
the excellent resellers from Germany - https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/ 
as well as some Chinese-brand graphics tablet Windows10-PC with a Wacom
stylus - that, sadly, was non-functional when it arrived in Bulgaria (and
it also had a fake Wacom pen rather than a real original one...)

* ...

## A list of display monitors that I have used

1. some nice Acer 22" {model-name/ID-here}BW LCD TFT display
2. a great-looking 8-bit-sRGB H-IPS HP LP2475w display monitor (I really love
its OSD & button-controls, as well as its amazing tilt&rotation-able stand) -
it is sold by Rmania.bg & by other 2nd-hand resellers like 
https://shop.itema-pg.com/product/1703/hp-lp2475w-24-profesionalen-monitor.html .
