HOWTO-MAKE-GNU-LINUX-WIN-THE-DESKTOP-OS-WARS.md

1. Continue making the kernel.org Linux baseline kernel as stable and well-maintained as possible, including as much backwards-compatibility & forwards-compatibility as possible, and support for the 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x branches apart from the current 5.x branch.
2. Continue to improve & make rock-solid stable all possible X.org/Galeon/Wayland/etc. desktop environments & make them adopt customizations & looks similar to that of MS Windows XP/7/8.1/10+ and of macOS, etc.; support the downloading & installation of older ones (older Linux kernels, KDE3, gnome2/MATE, etc.)
3. How to earn money from GNU/Linux & F(L)OSS:
a) donations
b) paid commercial support via online IMs, by email, by snail-mail, and by visit on the spot (if possible & affordable):
- general tech support (IT department)
- hardware support & consulations
- software support: Linux/HURD/etc. kernel support (including bug reports, feature requests, kernel build flags, computer-programmers fixing your problem and/or providing paid online support, etc.)
- software support: application software & bug fixes, feature requests, etc.
- localization, internationalization, and translation services - writing/translating tech manuals, edutainment HowTo videos, translating application software & kernel/OS internals & etc
- hardware maintenance & data backup & data recovery services
- firmware updates/installation & paid making of OS&computer-periphery drivers/firmware & bugfixes for drivers/firmware
c) selling of mostly-freed & FSF RYF open hardware devices & hardware spare parts
d) paid installation of mass hardware, software, OSs, drivers, firmware, killer apps, and cuatomization/configuration
e) web-hosting services
f) ISP (Internet access) services & ISP Internet-cabling-network-building& maintenance services
g) selling of retro consoles, modern remakes of retro consoles, cables, spare parts, etc.
h) selling of computer-maintenance kits & amateur/hobbyist computer boards and small computers & laptop/smartphone/tablet/phablet/UPS batteries/accessories/spare parts, etc.
i) bartering & ???
4. Graphics seem glitchy & have noticeable bad visual lag on Linux under X.org - make them crisper, more responsive, ICC color profiles support, improved graphics drivers for all X.org/Wayland/etc. desktop-environments, including multiple monitor/keyboard/mouse/joystick/webcam/graphics-tablet/etc. support!!! This is extremely crucial for Linux to compare well with MS Windows 7/8.1/10's DirectX & Direct3D, and with OpenGL 3+, SDL, etc.!!! Improve support for compatibility with MS Windows, macOS, Google Android, SailfishOS, etc.
5. Keep F(L)OSS afloat by daily/weekly/monthly/etc. microdonations - see e.g. how Linux Mint is mostly crowdfunded.
6. Keep popularizing GNU/Linux & F(L)OSS despite flame wars & personal in-fights!
7. CRUCIAL: Ship curated lists of the best, most stable killer apps into Linux distros, as well as provide hosted repositories to install the latest bleeding-edge apps, kernel updates, firmware, drivere, desktop customizations, etc. Also allow user repositories like Fedora COPR AppImages, Ubuntu LaunchPad.net PPAs, Arch Linux AUR packages, self-hosted & GitHub
com & GitLab.org & Gitea & etc. `git` repos, etc.
8. CRUCIAL: Maintain a lot of kernel & Linux distros software-downloading mirrors, including P2P-based ones, including older versions & tech manuals & HowTo guides! Keep the diversity&versatility of Linux distros alive!!!
9. CRUCIAL: Make F(L)OSS good for app dev (software engineering), gamedev (even for (new) paid commercial AAA titles), webdev, webhosting, etc.
10. Socialize, IRL network, crowdfund, make connections & profit together with others in the same field and across fields!!!
11. Maintain download mirrors for old, obsolete Linux distros & old-apps.com-like older apps!!! Maintain P2P file-sharing & gonzo/citizen-journalism-enabling software!
12. Decentralize the Intetnet & make the percloud distributer-network & OwnCloud-like devices ubiquitous, while staying away from excessive transhumanism, vendor lockdowns, walled gardens, patent trolls, disruptive/emerging tech, and political abuse of high-tech for crowd-control/-manipulation...
13. Keep the new more decentralized Internet free & open for everyone, while encouraging a minimum hygiene of online etiquette...
14. Make sure to kiss the asses of F(O)SS gurus/icons & tech gurus for saving your ass, & donate/help to support their amazing work! Also: find new, niche ways to use&utilize&profit from software & hardware to solve and/or alleviate IRL human problems.
15. Have fun while working/living/playing! P.S. Ensure that hardware recycling (&software reuse & idea remixing&adaptation) gets going and that physical resources & industrial 'means of production/processing' are utilized better, while providing minimum social-care social policies to the most disadvantaged without outright putting them in undeserved luxury or 'rainfall of money that they can't [yet] handle with enough care&conscientiousness' situations... Yeah, stuff like that.
16. Adapt, overcome...
