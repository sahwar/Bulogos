# A Modest Proposal For An Extending Update to the Default Linux kernel filesystem-hierarchy, by ve4ernik@gmail.com :
 Add a Linux kernel module that sets the user-preferred FSHS (LSB) - filesystem hierarchy: 0 (default: default Linux FHS; UNIX/*NIX-compatible), 1 (borrowed from GoboLinux ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoboLinux ) - ve4ernik website links, influenced by MS Windows self-contained directories/folders), 2 (same as 1 BUT with additional soft-linked dirs to the default Linux FHS, and backup default-Linux-FHS dirs as they usually are - similar to system-protected files in the OS-folders 'win32'&'WoW64' dirs of MS Windows OS), 3 (new systemd-2020 user-management & /home/-dir management, 4 (user-programmed), 5 (placeholder for non-systemd/systemd-free other initfreedom.org init-script...), 6 (same as 5 but with the 1) filesystem hierarchy), 7 (same as 5 but with the 2 filesystem hierarchy), 8-999999 = placeholders for user-specified, user-programmed init scripts & user-supplied custom/mod Linux filesystem hierarchies...)...
