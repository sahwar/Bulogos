just do a google web-search with the keywords from the title of this file or
do a similar web-search on http://youtube.com or http://vimeo.com or http://dailymotion.com
and watch the videos with demonstrations of this tactile-holographic-displays tech coming to reality JUST SOME YEARS AGO (discard and disregard the fake-CGI-generated tech, only take notice of the real tech!!!)...

(Examples:

I, http://twitter.com/ve4ernik already discussed the practical reality of interactive holographic GUI/UI/UX (+ AR/VR/wearable-IoT/'Matrix-like Neuralink by Elon Musk & co.'/brain-microchip-implant-linked-to-the-Internet-and-to-supercomputers-via-(Starlink-etc.)-satellites on the hit USA TV show 'Intelligence (2014)', 'Man of Interest', 
and 'Deus Ex: Human Evolution' (and sequels), and on Mass Effect 1-3 (video-games), etc. ) some years ago (2014-2020).

The major idea is borrowed from (&further expanded via R&D and modifications) the video sequence from the 1st episode of the Cartoon Network Western-animation series 'MegasXLR' where
the hot female character Kiva uses moveable interactive tactile+voice-recognition/voice-control (+more electronic sensors, etc.) holographic displays aboard the prototype for 
the Megas Japanese-manga/-anime mech (giant super-robot piloted by humans)... etc.

Video-clip of Kiva from that MegasXLR episode:

https://www.google.com/search?q=megasxlr+season+1+pilot
https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3302pt

(the main idea is about a kitchen-table-like 3D-cube / 4D-tesseract for tactile/voice-input/virtual-keyboard-mice-or-via-human-hand-control in tactile 3D space within the holograph/holography cube, etc. )

/O\ :DDD

ADDENDUM:

Further ideas can be borrowed from these products/design-ideas (this is an extension of the above main idea...):

EyeMove PC (detachable two sides of a sphere/disc - I saw this concept design from an issue of the Bulgarian-language magazine PCMania.bg 07/2008, p. 11) + Google Lens (same as in Mass Effect 1/2/3 Lens-glasses with AR/VR and in the transhumanist TV-series Intelligence (2014) + Person of Interest (2011-) + X-Men Cable (character)'s 1990-CartoonNetwork-TV-series A.I.-cube portable-computer { https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cable_(comics)&oldid=961474149 ; video demonstrating the portable cube computer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGS_1LYwkVs - 'X-MEN Cable's Computer (AWESOME)'} + wrist-band micro-computer super-computer idea by ve4ernik
