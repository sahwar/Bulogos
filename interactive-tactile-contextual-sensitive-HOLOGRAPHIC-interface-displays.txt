just do a google web-search with the keywords from the title of this file or
do a similar web-search on http://youtube.com or http://vimeo.com or http://dailymotion.com
and watch the videos...

I, http://twitter.com/ve4ernik already discussed the practical reality of interactive holographic GUI/UI/UX (+ AR/VR/wearable-IoT/'Matrix-like Neuralink by Elon Musk & co.'/brain-microchip-implant-linked-to-the-Internet-and-to-supercomputers-via-(Starlink-etc.)-satellites on the hit USA TV show 'Intelligence (2014)', 'Man of Interest', 
and 'Deus Ex: Human Evolution' (and sequels), and on Mass Effect 1-3 (video-games), etc. )

The major idea is borrowed from (&further expanded via R&D and modifications) the video sequence from the 1st episode of the Cartoon Network Western-animation series 'MegasXLR' where
the hot female character Kiva uses moveable interactive tactile+voice-recognition/voice-control (+more electronic sensors, etc.) holographic displays aboard the prototype for 
the Megas Japanese-manga/-anime mech (giant super-robot piloted by humans)... etc.
