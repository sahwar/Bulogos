https://github.com/sahwar/Bulogos/blob/master/TODO-original-ideas-to-later-work-on.txt

* put my personal website in a self-hosted locally-hosted git-changelog:
http://sites.google.com/view/ve4ernik
+ backup to local .zip archives all my content from ALL my online accounts (see above for the list), including from
http://facebook.com & http://instagram.com , http://pastebin.com , http://imgur.com, http://9gag.com , http://dailymotion.com , 
http://motifake.com , http://4chan.org , http://8chan.org , http://danbooru.donmai.us , http://reddit.com/r/'s , etc.

* open the last 50-200 .txt files (via voidtools.com Search Everything -> Sort by Modified) and extract the information needed to be added to Bulogos & to ve4ernik's website & ve4ernik's podcast (including my GMail/abv.bg emails + my .txt notes from my smartphones' Note-taking apps + the synched/copied .txt lists of my webbookmarks & opened tabs from the mobile web-browsers of my Google Android devices, etc. )
* buy new HDDs/SSDs/USB-flashsticks & rsync/FreeFileSync/.VHD-image/.ISO image _backup_ the full contents of my older, towards-failing HDDs... and finish compiling my information posted on http://reddit.com/r/DataHoarder , etc.

* finish writing up the list of my ideas about how to fix the GUI text-cutting issues in paint.net & its MS-Windows GUI-engine - 
those related to properly displaying the full text of localized text strings in the GUI/UI; this also applies to any GUIs in
general - including Linux/*NIX desktop-environments & window-managers, and to MS-Windows-7/8.1/10's GUI (especially the taskbar,
the START menu & its items, the OS/system context (right-click) menus, and the 3rd-party-apps-specific context menus, and even
to the OS's/desktop-environment/file-manager's 'Open.../Save as.../Browse.../Select folder/directory...' dialog windows and to the file-managers and desktop-view in general (some borrowed from Windows7's file-manager & from SpaceFM & Nautilus-fork & to Qt4+-based alternative file-managers (also see http://distrowatch.com about the better mounting mechanism in newer versions of some Linux apps), etc.)...
* also suggest some improvements to paint.net - like icon-packs, some advanced shapes-drawing adjustments (like diameter/radius of
ovals set by entering a number in a floating text-field), implementing MyPaint's&Krita's brush engines as additional brush engines
parallel to the classic paint.net Brush tool; adding some GUI ideas from other image-editing apps, like ibisPaintX / MediBang Paint Pro 
(Google Android apps), SpeedyPainter + the search-in-all-menus'-text searchbar (searching through English+localized text+keyboard 
shortcuts) similar to that found in Wox &  & in `plotinus` app on GitHub.com, etc.
* suggest my ingenious idea about how to (GUI/UI/UX ways) show text-ToolTips (<abbr> & <acronym> and qTip2) in the GUI in mobile web-browsers like
Mozilla Firefox mobile for Google Android & Google Chrome mobile for Google Android... Currently, almost no mobile web-browser
supports showing these on mobile touchscreen devices...
* finish my proposal for an updated QWERTY-like Bulgarian keyboard layout & GUI/UI/UX for old dumbphones/feature phones + for 
them to support a mouse-like small touchpad/stylus-on-touchscreen + advanced zooming/scaling of the contents of their new & 
advanced web-browser and for opened images & small video-clips & streaming animatedGIFs
* write an article about that free app that uses MPEG-1/MPEG-2/MPEG-TS/MJPEG to record&webcast-webstream live from a webcam
hooked to the Internet + the same app that also utilizes hacks of the animatedGIF filetype to record & live-stream webcam live/timeskipped-'chronograph'
video (with an HTML5-added audio-stream to go with the animatedGIF web-stream - with the audio-stream being capture from the 
webcam and/or an additional hooked microphone) --- this is a fun idea for snooping around your neighborhood & for video-surveillance
of your home or some other location where you have put a video-camera on (covertly/secretly or to be seen by all, etc.)...
* finish compiling the file with the list of common/popular image dimensions - I submitted such a bug report to the GIMP bug-tracker ages ago but it got
partially rejected. When completed and verified, it could work for almost any image-editing app: GIMP2+, Krita, MyPaint, LazPaint,
paint.net, SpeedyPainter, Medibang Paint Pro, Google-Android-specific image-editors, etc. - since it's just a plain-text 
.xml/.json/.ini file.
* add the information about special metadata from the email about the latest version of paint.net + the information from one of the
files here in the Bulogos tree of files - the one about CJK characters and CJK typography... + EXIF & XnView/nomacs/IrfanView-viewable
metadata fields when opening a file --- to my (ve4ernik's) fused idea about having a manual text-box to enter (or to later edit or remove or export to an external file - even to an external USB-/Bluetooth-connected device)
such metadata for modern camera-produced .jpg/.jpeg/.RAW & .mp4/.m4a digital-photograph & digital-videoclip videocamera fileformats;
* write an explanatory article about the following apps found on GitHub: latex2html5 & pdf2html5 & lossless-img2pdf & waifu2x (and similar image super-resolution) on GitHub 
* write some basic apps on algorithmic music composition inspired by the excellent work of http://twitter.com/bozhobg
* 
* etc.
