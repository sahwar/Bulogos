(This electronic copy was produced via the open-source software tool img2pdf and is a collation of scanned pages converted to digital images. You have to process the pdf (or djvu)
yourself via OCR software (like commercial ABBYY Reader or open-source OCRFeeder, octoOCR artificial-neural-network software, ocroread, tesseract-ocr, etc.) and then also view & edit/proofread the result of the OCR software to fix errors in OCR-ing... and this is a VERY long, tedious, time-consuming, and repetitive job... which is why IDI Spellchecker is sold for quite a lot of BGN money since 2012 (the author did OCR on the 2012 dictionary and later added some intentionally wrong orthographic spellings so as to catch people who reverse-engineered the commercial proprietary version of IDI Spellchecker to get the dictionary wordlist database...)).
