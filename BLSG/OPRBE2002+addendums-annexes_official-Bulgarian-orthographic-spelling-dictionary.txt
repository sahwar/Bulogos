Due to licensing/copyright issues, we can only provide you with a hyperlink to download an electronic copy of the PRBE (ПРБЕ2002) dictionary for personal fair-use (you can still buy the print edition from bookstores):

(This electronic edition contains ONLY the introductory 2002 Style Guide at the beginning of the dictionary and NOT the later dictionary pages with the actual dictionary list of words (spelling/orthography) BUT the text is electronic so it is selectable and copyable as a proper PDF straight from Adobe InDesign, XQuark Express, or Scribus!!!)
