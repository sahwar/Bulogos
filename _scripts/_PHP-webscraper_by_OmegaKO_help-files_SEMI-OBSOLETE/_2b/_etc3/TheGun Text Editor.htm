<p><font color="#33CCFF">Version 3.0f has had minor internal changes and
has taken advantage of the technology of a new linker written by Pelle
Orinius to bring it down to its preferred size of 6k (</font><b><font color="#FFCC00">6144</font></b><font color="#33CCFF">
bytes). TheGun from its origin was designed to be useful within the boundaries
of minimum size, high speed performance and no useless features. Its original
purpose was to dump results from a compiler or an assembler build into
for display which demanded near instant load.</font><font color="#33CCFF"></font>
<p><font color="#33CCFF">TheGun does not use any additional runtime DLLs
and is coded in Microsoft Assembler (</font><b><font color="#FFCC00">MASM</font></b><font color="#33CCFF">)
using the Windows API functions.. It does not use or write to the registry
at all and will run on Windows versions from Win95b upwards. In common
with the last version, it uses a very high speed dispatcher internally
for system message processing, it now tests for read only files and handles
the XP style of file dialog correctly. It uses an extended version of the
system "MessageBox" to display various forms of information.</font><font color="#33CCFF"></font>
<p><font color="#33CCFF">For 6k in file size, it is fully drag and drop
enabled, it supports wordwrap and it has a seperate accessory to change
some of the startup settings. The accessory is </font><b><font color="#FFCC00">SETGUN.EXE</font></b><font color="#33CCFF">
and it patches the settings directly into the disk file so there is no
need for an INI file or a registry setting. It has a system defined text
search capacity where you can search for text with the options of case
sensitive, insensitive or search for whole words only. There is "right
click" support for the menu options built into TheGun. You can quickly
exit TheGun by pressing the ESC key.</font><font color="#33CCFF"></font>
<p><font color="#33CCFF">TheGun does not have an effective file size limit
and the maximum size that can be loaded into it is determined by available
memory and loading speed of the file. It can typically load files in excess
of 10 megabytes with no problems. It has been speed optimised for both
file load and save.</font><font color="#33CCFF"></font>
<p><font color="#33CCFF">Printing is a low priority issue with a text editor
of this type and the capacity it has is farmed out to the system file Wordpad.Exe.
The margin settings are those that are set in Wordpad.</font><font color="#33CCFF"></font>
<p><font color="#33CCFF">TheGun still maintains its size and speed advantage
over the system Notepad.Exe so if these are issues that, Number One Son
will do the job for you "<b>just fine</b>".</font>
