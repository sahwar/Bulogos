<p>I am interested in the situation where you have a very interesting result. For instance, you have solved a very important open problem. However, you are not known in the field and do not have any remarkable publications. Your supervisor thinks the work is good and you submit the work to a high profile journal, but you get rejected.</p>

<p>The thing is that the contribution is very strong. It breaks what most people believe or what they have already proven: e.g., you solve the P vs. NP problem or any other well known open problem. </p>

<p>The reviewers strongly reject your work with no justification and they do not state why the result is wrong. Examples of reviewer comments include:</p>

<ul>
<li>"The proof must be wrong." </li>
<li>"You cannot achieve such a result." </li>
<li>"You do not understand well the notion of ..."</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is what to do in this situation? Where to go? If your advisor accepts the work, but the reviewers from the top journal reject the work without even explaining the mistakes,  what should you do?</p>

But then again, maybe not; maybe the presentation is just poor, or the claim too outrageous for some hearts/minds. Upload to arXiv for the time stamp and keep improving form and submitting. Your name does not (read: should not) matter when submitting an article so being unknown is not (read: should not be) an issue. Being known for half-baked crank stuff, on the other hand, is: avoid creating that impression at all cost!</span>

<p>The main issue is that, even in asking this relatively simple question, your writing is far from clear.  If you cannot write clearly in this situation, your chances of writing up a difficult piece of mathematics or theoretical computer science are less than good.  For instance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His/Her supervisor(s) accept the work and they published it in a highly known journal and they get rejected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laying aside issues of subject/verb agreement and consistency of tense, the entire sentence doesn't make sense: you can't publish a paper and get rejected.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It breaks what most people believe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know what it means to "break what most people believe".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>or what they have already proven,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? Are you saying that your proof contradicts other proven results?  Taken literally, that would mean that you have shown mathematics to be inconsistent.  In practice this could only mean that if your result is correct then some previously published work is incorrect.  If that's the case then you need to be very clear about that and explain the flaws in the earlier work.  It distresses me that you don't really seem to believe this but are just throwing it off as loose language. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i.e., He/She solves the P vs. NP problem or any other well known open problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Solving an open problem would not "break what people have already proven"....that's what it means for the problem to be open.  Also saying "P vs. NP problem or any other well known open problem" is a strange bit of coyness: there is no other problem in theoretical computer science (and very few to none in mathematics as a whole) which is "like" P vs. NP.  So it doesn't make sense to give that as an example.  It's like saying "i.e., he found the Holy Grail or some other famous cup".  </p>

<p>In other questions you have spoken specifically about having a proof of P vs. NP and then upon questioning have retreated from this.  This sort of vacillation about what you have done is a red flag of "crankiness" that will make professionals wary.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reviewers strongly reject his/her work with no justification and they said that the result must be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saying that the result must be wrong is not just a justification for rejection, it's the <em>best</em> justification.  No professional reviewer will say something is wrong lightly.  Almost any reviewer who says this will point to at least one specific error.  If they do not, then in practice it almost certainly means that the entire document did not make enough sense to them to be more specific. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your advisor accepts the work, the reviewers reject the work without even explain the mistakes (it is the "best" journal in his/her domain) then what he/she must do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you submit a paper to the top journal in your field claiming a solution to the top problem in your field, and your paper does not make sense or does not evince even a correct understanding of the problem, then the editors are likely not to want to spend much time in response.  On the other hand, if you are sincerely interested in getting their expertise, it seems reasonable to write back very politely and ask for more specifics about the error.  If your response is in any way argumentative then you risk the editorial staff thinking that you will keep hounding them <em>ad infinitum</em>, and at some point they <em>have to</em> stop replying.  So you should write back saying that you are not considering resubmitting the paper to that journal but for your own progress it would be extremely helpful to know what is wrong with it.  You could also mention that your supervisor found the paper to be correct.</p>

<p>In fact you could be getting more help on this from your supervisor.  If you have really "solved P vs. NP problem or any other well known open problem" and your supervisor believes your solution to be correct, why isn't your supervisor moving heaven and earth to be sure your work is getting the attention it deserves?  That doesn't add up.  The two possible explanations seem to be (i) your supervisor is being too polite with you: s/he does not actually believe that you have solved P vs. NP; and (ii) your advisor's imprimatur does not carry any weight in the community whatsoever.  The latter unfortunately means his/her opinion on the correctness of your work is not worth very much.  </p>

<p>A good way to find out whether it's (i), (ii) or -- I do admit that anything is possible! perhaps the top journal in your field is unfairly ignoring your revolutionary work -- is to seek your advisor's help in getting another faculty member to evaluate the work, preferably someone in the department that you can speak to recently.</p>

<p>Finally, you seem to have some real worries that if an unknown person solves a famous problem then it somehow doesn't count.  This is really not the way academia works, provided the unknown person is capable of presenting the work in a way which makes sense to the experts (and if not, what a shame, but what else could one possibly expect?).  Have you heard of the recent example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitang_Zhang">Yitang Zhang</a>?  Zhang was a non-tenure-track lecturer at the University of New Hampshire when he stunned the mathematical world by proving the existence of bounded prime gaps.  He submitted his work to the top mathematical journal...and by all accounts they accepted it <em>with unusual speed</em>.  In other words, they received a paper from someone they had probably never heard of, looked at it quickly and saw that it was a plausible attack on a huge open problem, and as a result they sprung into action much more rapidly and thoroughly than for most submissions they get.  This is an amazing story, but a true one, and it shows how the community responds to a <em>real</em> situation like this.</p>

Again, this is not a crime, but doing this in one&#39;s academic work could certainly lead to its lack of understanding and thus rejection.  Look at it this way: wouldn&#39;t it be nice if language issues were most of the source of the OP&#39;s difficulties?

<p>First, make sure you are not really a crank before trying to convince others. 
Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_%28person%29#Common_characteristics_of_cranks">these common characteristics of cranks</a>. 
If they apply to you then get professional help.</p>

<p>For the rest of the answer 
I will assume that you have really solved a famous open problem.
In the following 
"he" refers to a typical non-expert claiming to have a solution for a famous open problem and
"she" refers to an expert in the topic.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>There is no easy shortcut for you!</strong><br>
If you are looking for a simple easy shortcut to get your solution verified by an expert
then this answer is not for you 
and I can assure you what you want is not going to happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understand the magnitude of your claim!</strong><br>
E.g. If you are claiming to have a proof of P is not equal to NP 
then you are the guy who is claiming to have a design for a rocket 
that can be built with the currently technology and resources 
to take a human to Andromeda and back safely 
while experts are having hard time sending a human to mars. 
If you are claiming to have a proof of P is equal to NP 
then you are the guy who is claiming to have a time travel machine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understand why experts are reluctant to directly engage non-experts.</strong><br>
Many experts would be interested to know about any major progress in their field. 
E.g. there are complexity theorists who 
do read <em>every</em> P vs. NP related paper posted on <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/all/1/ti%3a+AND+P+NP/0/1/0/all/0/1">arXiv</a> 
(arXiv has a very lenient acceptance policy regarding P vs. NP claims).
They will definitely let other experts know 
if they notice something interesting. 
But </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>You are not the only one with such claims.</strong><br>
There are thousands of people who regularly make such claims.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>All previous ones suffered from trivial issues no expert would have made.</strong><br>
It is your job to show you are not one of them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Her time is valuable.</strong><br>
For most it is not really monetary. 
But I think giving some numbers would be helpful. 
In my university a graduate student is paid over $40/hour 
to mark simple undergraduate assignments.
This is nothing compared to what an expert might charge for consulting in the industry.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-experts often lack basic skills and knowledge to understand her replies.</strong><br>
E.g. he lacks mathematical maturity, 
he does not know basic definitions and terminology, etc.
It is not uncommon that an expert tells a non-expert 
what he has is not a proof. 
She does not mean the proof is incorrect, 
she means it is not even a proof in the sense that 
an apple is not a proof.
He does not understand when he is told it is "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">not even wrong!</a>". To make him understand her reply 
she would have to teach him those required skills and knowledge,
too much work just to convince him he does not have a solution.
Often he is not patient nor interested in learning (e.g. reading a textbook),
he is only interested in a confirmation of what he believes to be a solution.
Way too much work in that case.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It is often impossible to satisfy him.</strong><br>
Because of the points mentioned above, 
he often insists on the validity of his claim 
even after she tells him it is not. 
At other times where he understands the reply
he considers it a simple easy-to-fix error,
not a fundamental one.
He tries to fix it and get her verify it.
This leads to back and forth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>He underestimates the required time and effort on her part to answer his claim.</strong><br>
He thinks it is a simple easy job for her to answer his claim. 
E.g. he expects her to give him a counterexample where his algorithm fails.
Finding a counterexample for an algorithm is a very difficult task 
(as anyone who has marked undergraduate algorithms or complexity theory assignments would know). 
Finding an explanation why an idea is fundamentally flawed and cannot work 
is even more difficult.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>He does not understand it is not a puzzle.</strong><br>
She is not interested in the question just for its own sake.
She expects the solution to the question will be accompanied with
major advances in her field.
E.g. complexity theorists do not care about P vs. NP just for its own sake.
They expect the solution for P vs. NP will come with 
major progress in our understanding about the nature of efficient computation and
its limitations.
Often he does not understand this.
He thinks of the question as a game or puzzle that he thinks he has won and that is it.
This attitude is frustrating for experts.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Now here are some tips:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Be humble.</strong><br>
It is much easier to get her to have a look at your solution
if you are genuinely humble and eager to learn and accepting 
if you are told that you are wrong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure you understand what is required to solve the question.</strong><br>
E.g. understand that a program that seems to efficiently solve an NP-complete problem is not a proof, 
understand that an idea does not make a proof, 
make sure you understand the definitions and terminology, 
etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know the basics.</strong><br>
I keep repeating this: <em><strong>read a good textbook</strong></em> on the topic and solve its exercises. 
It is beneficial for you as you will know more and will be more convincing. 
It is beneficial for her because you will not waste her time 
with simple mistakes that you would have noticed yourself if you had read a good textbook. 
It is annoying to deal with people who claim to have solved P vs. NP 
but repeatedly make basic mistakes that 
a good student who has taken an undergraduate course on the topic will not make.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use your real name.</strong><br>
Not using your real name indicates that you are trying to avoid suffering any potential negative consequence of your claim being incorrect. 
Using your real name indicates that you are sure enough to be ready to suffer potential negative professional consequences if you are mistaken, 
so you can be taken more seriously. 
If you are not completely sure about your claim do not waste her time. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don't shirk. Do your share before expecting help from others.</strong><br>
If you want her to look at your solution you should spend 10 times more time and effort than she will spend helping you. 
For claims about P vs. NP you have to do way more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You will not get more than one chance.</strong><br>
Make it count. 
If on the first page of your paper she finds a silly mistake or a basic error 
(e.g. you do not even know the definitions of P and NP) 
then she will be done with your claims forever.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understand the known obstacles for solving the question and why they do not apply to your solution.</strong><br>
E.g. if you are claiming P is not equal to NP then you should have a good idea 
why relaltivization and natural proofs barriers do not apply to your solution. 
Similarly if you are claiming P is equal to NP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Try to prove simpler more acceptable claims.</strong><br>
E.g. if you have a proof of P is equal to NP then 
you should also have a proof of simpler weaker major results like Factoring is in P. 
If you can extract a clean proof for such claims then 
you can first try publishing them.
Such results can be much easier to get verified as they are considered more likely.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure your solution is not too strong.</strong><br>
In other words, make sure it does not contradict other known results. 
E.g. if your argument for P is equal to NP would also show that P is equal to ExpTime 
(which we know is false) 
then you are in trouble 
(Scott Aaronson mentions a few more cases of too strong results in his blog post
<a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=458">Eight Signs A Claimed P≠NP Proof Is Wrong</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check your solution.</strong><br>
Make sure there are no mistakes. 
All steps should easily seen to follow from the previous ones. 
Make sure you do not make extra assumptions at any point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recheck your solution.</strong><br>
Put your proof aside completely for two weeks or more. 
Do not think about it. 
Then go back and recheck it with a fresh mind 
as if you were checking someone else's solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build evidence for your claims.</strong><br>
E.g. if you have a <em>really efficient</em> algorithm 
(i.e. its running time is a polynomial with small constants)
which you have proven to solve an NP-complete problem then 
it should not be a difficult task to beat the state-of-art <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/">SAT-solvers</a> or 
to break various cryptographic protocols based on hardness conjectures 
(those conjectures will be false if P is equal to NP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Write easy-to-read concise clean abstract and introduction.</strong><br>
Do not put any unnecessary background/history/philosophical consequences/discussion of importance/general commentary. 
It is a famous open problem;
every expert knows its significance.
Save them for your final version.
Right now you should focus on convincing her that your claim is correct.
She first wants an easy-to-read short error-free convincing high-level explanation of your solution. 
It should also explain why any known obstacles do not apply to your solution.
It should also contain any other evidence that can support the correctness of your claim. If you fail the reader is not likely to continue reading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure the rest of your paper matches your abstract and introduction.</strong><br>
If you fail the reader is not likely to continue reading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure every detail in your paper is correct.</strong><br>
Follow the standard structure of papers in the topic.
Check a few famous well-written papers in the area that have solved major open problems.
All definitions should be clear, easy to understand, and rigorous. 
Every theorem (lemma, etc.) should be clearly and rigorously stated, and
the proof of each of them should follow their statement. 
She should be able to see why each claim in the proof is correct based on the previous steps, definitions, and lemmas without too much trouble. 
If you fail the reader is not likely to continue reading.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have a general expert who <em>personally</em> knows you check your solution.</strong><br>
I am assuming that you do not know personally any expert in the area of the question.
The closer the general expert is to the area of the question the better it will be. 
E.g. for P vs. NP, you can ask a mathematician, preferably a theoretical computer scientist.
Opinion of people who are not experts in the topic may not have much weight 
but it will make sure you are not making some simple mistake.<br>
Understand that at this point someone 
who does not know you personally has no reason to check your solution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Have <em>another</em> general expert who knows you <em>personally</em> check your solution.</strong><br>
Rome was not built in a day. 
You have to build confidence in your solution little by little.
Those you convince can become your bridges to reach the experts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If they are convinced ask them to show your solution to an expert they know.</strong><br>
E.g. for P vs. NP, ask them to show it to a complexity theorist they know.
At this point you are less likely to be making a basic mistake and 
you have good evidence to support your claim. 
Your solution now requires the expertise of an expert in the topic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If she is convinced she will definitely show it to other experts.</strong><br>
News about any major progress in an area will spread very fast among the experts in that area. Other experts (complexity theorists in the case P vs. NP) will recheck your solution independently. 
If they are convinced you will probably get an invitation to submit your paper to a famous journal (something like <a href="http://jacm.acm.org/">JACM</a> in the case of P vs. NP).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not claim to solve a famous open problem more than once.</strong><br>
As I wrote above, 
you will not get more than one chance! 
You do not have a right to ask her to see what is wrong with your fixed solution 
if you made a mistake.
(The exception is when she <em>explicitly</em> asks you to try to fix your solution and 
send the fixed version back to her.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not expect an explanation for why your idea cannot work.</strong><br>
It is unlikely that someone would be able to show formally that an informal idea cannot work. 
If the idea is formal enough then the reason that it cannot work can be a new interesting result in itself; 
however, proving such results can be even more difficult than solving the original question. 
In the case of P vs. NP,
if you are claiming to have an efficient algorithm for an NP-hard problem 
you should not expect her to find an input where your algorithm fails.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In summary,</p>

<p><strong>Understand that she is not required to help you.
If she is helping you she is doing so out of generosity.
She has a right to stop it whenever she pleases without any explanation.
Be mindful of her time, 
do not waste it for what you could/should have done yourself,
try to make her job in helping you as easy as possible,
and do not do anything that will make her regret trying to help you.</strong></p>

                <span class="comment-copy">@Jack, here is what I meant: some people treat P vs. NP like a one level computer game with a Yes or No answer that they have to win. We (complexity theorist) care about P vs. NP because we believe that settling the question will be accompanied with significant progress in our understanding of the nature of efficient computation and its limitations, we don&#39;t care about it just for its own sake. As Scott wrote once: &quot;<i>[We] like to take P vs. NP as our “flagship example” of a huge class of questions about what is and isn’t feasible for computers, none of which we know how to answer.</i>&quot;</span>

There is no reason to think that such an algorithm should be &quot;real&quot; efficient: it may have abysmal performance on all inputs that we can store. Otherwise, good answer.

<p>What does your advisor say about all this?</p>

<p>If she really believes you have solved this major problem, she should be moving mountains to help you publish and disseminate it.  (It sounds like her name is on it too, so she has an even greater incentive.)  But you've used the rather lukewarm phrasing that she "accepts" it.  Better get her completely on board first, or get her to explain in more detail her reservations (which may indeed turn out to reveal fatal flaws).</p>

<p>The advantage you have over the average crank is that, as a student, you already have ties to the scientific community, through your advisor.   <strong>Take advantage of this.</strong>  Once you and your advisor are satisfied that your manuscript is of the best possible quality (see ff254's answer), post it on arXiv, and circulate.  Your advisor surely knows experts in the field, and should have enough reputation that she can get them interested in it.  </p>

<p>I'm not sure about your field, but in mathematics, this currently tends to be the way that the community handles solutions to major open problems.  You don't just submit it to <em>Annals</em>, have the referees approve it, and then wait a few months until everyone gets their issue of <em>Annals</em> in the mail and is astonished.  Instead, you get the community to study it <em>first</em>.  You convince a few experts that it is plausible enough to be worth their attention, and they look at it.  Either they find a critical flaw right away (the most common case), or they find a lesser flaw that you or someone else fixes, and maybe, gradually, a consensus develops that it is probably right.  <em>That's</em> when you send it to <em>Annals</em>.</p>

<p>One thing that worries me in what you wrote is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It breaks what most people believe or what they have already proven...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Which is it?</strong>   The distinction is crucial.  If it contradicts people's intuition, that raises the bar a little, but scientists are used to being surprised.  If it contradicts something previously proved, that raises the bar a lot.  It puts on you the burden of not only showing that your work is right, but showing specifically why the previously accepted work was actually wrong.  (You can't just say "Mine is right, therefore theirs must be wrong.")  You didn't say anything about having done that.  (And if you <em>can't</em> find a flaw in the previous work, then your claim is in fact along the lines of "Mathematics is inconsistent".  The bar on <em>that</em> one is more or less on the moon.)</p>

Short version: serious mathematician thinks he&#39;s found a proof that math (PA) is inconsistent, explains it clearly enough that experts can understand, a top mathematician reads the outline and spots the error, and the author retracts the proof.  So even really extraordinary claims will be looked it if they&#39;re explained clearly and reasonably by a sensible person.</span>

<p>May I add to Nate Eldredge's  comprehensive answer that, if your work shakes or shatters the commonly held views in your community, then it is very important that you reconcile those views with yours, by which I mean: show exactly where the community is "wrong" or "not exactly right" and why. Offer counterexamples, predictions, all you can. </p>

<p>By attacking your own proof even stronger than the others do. </p>

<p>Seriously, there is a reason why people in your discipline haven't been able to find the answer for centuries. The a priori probability that you are wrong is so high that even when you have created a good looking proof, the a posteriori probability that you are right is way too low. This means that, if you know enough of your own discipline, you should not be convinced that you solved it. Given a problem which has resisted solution for a long time, being convinced that you solved it just because you have a proof you believe in is a sure sign of a crackpot. </p>

<p>So non-crackpot behavior in such a case will be to try to take the proof apart, shoot it down, tear it to pieces from all possible angles. This is what your peers will be doing, and this is what they will expect you to be doing. To forget your pride, your subjective biases, and to be merciless to your own result. </p>

<p>They you only believe you after you have found more ways to disprove your result than they themselves can think of, tried them all, and failed in all of them. And your paper has to clearly show that this is what you did. Anything else will earn you the crackpot title. </p>

<p>Some advice is to very carefully check that the proofs are correct, ask one's supervisor for advice, and seek third opinions. Perhaps the supervisor has colleagues in the research area who would be willing to read the draft and offer concrete feedback.</p>

<p>If the journal submitted to is good, yet the reviewers did not give any useful feedback at all, then there is almost certainly a problem with the abstract and introduction.</p>

<p>The abstract and introduction should make clear the new idea that allows this "breakthrough". Presumably many have approached this problem in the past and failed; there may be widespread beliefs about why it is difficult to prove or perhaps even known "barriers" to attempted proofs. The abstract and introduction should clearly and briefly mention why such beliefs, objections, or barriers do not apply or how they were overcome.</p>

<p>In short, the abstract and introduction must give the skeptical reader reason to believe the paper could be correct, given the reader's background knowledge. If this is done, I would hope that reviewers would at least mention why they do not believe the result.</p>

It is hard to say how many papers are rejected this way but Elsevier <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/connect/8-reasons-i-rejected-your-article" rel="nofollow">say that they reject</a> 30 to 50 percent of papers without a review for other "technical reasons". See also <a href="http://econ.la.psu.edu/~kkrishna/Papers/The_inside_scoop.pdf" rel="nofollow">this paper</a> about how editors can save time by looking at author attributes such as affiliation to reject papers without looking at them.</p>

<p>I have personal experience of this because I recently <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8217" rel="nofollow">made significant progress</a> on a well known 100 year old open problem after experts in the field had said that future progress was likely to be very slow. The journal I submitted the paper to rejected it as soon as I confirmed that I had no affiliation. There was no reviewer report and they did not give any specific reason. I had complied with all their technical requirements for submission.</p>

<p>However, I pointed out to them that according to the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/files/Code_of_conduct_for_journal_editors_1.pdf" rel="nofollow">code of conduct</a> of the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/" rel="nofollow">committee on publication ethics</a> to which the journal claims to adhere "Editorial decisions should not be affected by the origins of the manuscript" and "Journals should have a declared mechanism for authors to appeal against editorial decisions." To my surprise they responded after a delay to tell me that they would look at it again.</p>

<p>It is true that there are many claimed resolutions of problems such as P vs NP that can be dismissed at a moments glance. This can be done because there are well understood reasons why these problem are hard and a solution would need to address that. Many claimed proofs of open problems by non-academics descend quickly into non-standard language that makes it hard to even address why they are wrong so they are just ignored by the community. It is up to the authors to make sure they communicate their ideas correctly.</p>

<p>If you do have a solution to an open problem my advice is to submit to an open repository such as arXiv. If you can't get an endorser use viXra or figshare (full disclosure: I am viXra admin) Do not pay attention to negative things said about viXra. It's purpose is just to give you an independent time-stamp and an archived copy you can point to. It does not attempt to review or give your work credibility in any way. The last thing you should do is submit to journals or send to experts without having a verified public copy because if it really is a breakthrough there is a real risk of plagiarism that can only be averted by having a prior copy archived.  </p>

<p>While most of the answers seems to have much confidence in the academic system, I would like to offer another viewpoint.</p>

<p>I think it is in fact much harder for an unknown (to a specific field) to
present a solution to the scientic community than normally expected. </p>

<p>Scientists <em>do</em> screw up and sometimes royally.<br>
First example: The infamous Monty Hall problem.<br>
More than 65% of all professional answers to Marilyn (with all sorts of academic
grades including statisticians) strongly rejected their answers, sometimes with
outright jeers and taunts.
This included Paul Erdos and Straight Dope Cecil Adams.
So even the majority of experts can fail.</p>

<p>Second example: The also infamous neutrino anomaly.
The interesting thing here is not the error itself, but the reaction on
Arxiv. Anyone who would have dared to offer superluminal theories before
the announcement would have been immediately declared as relativity crank.
After the announcement papers came flooding in offering all sorts of
superluminal theories explaining what we know now to be simply a
bad cable.</p>

<p>What are the problems an unknown may face ?</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/help/registerhelp" rel="nofollow">Arxiv.</a> You need an affiliation from an university or research institute
and/or an endorsement from a know author. Arxiv can revoke or limit your
access without explanation. This requirement also applies to fully qualified
scientists which are working in companies.</p></li>
<li><p>Journals. Too many people are trying to get their results published in too few
respectable journals. Journals also pretty scale bad, you have to wait a long
time to get published. Lesser known journals may have lower barriers, but you
have the real danger that the contribution is missed. And even the lower
journals may reject the paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Scientists. The situation is different in various countries, but normally
scientists are overworked and underpaid. They have not the time nor the
resources to review contributions with the very slim chance to get a
scientific jackpot.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If someone thinks the viewpoint is not valid, try just for fun to supply
a normal paper under a pseudonym and the home address.</p>

<p>The only viable option I see is to get contact to the scientists in the field
and try to work with them over the contribution which may be harder than it
sounds. The list provided by Kaveh is a good resource to start with.</p>

Violating relativity is a <i>really terrible</i> problem. All particles have &quot;normal&quot; rest mass (m=0 =&gt; v=c / m &gt; 0 =&gt; v &lt; c), there is no way to get a non conflicting description of FTL events with separate observers because RT is needed to describe time and space properties correctly. Please explain to a crank that FTL of normal matter should be considered impossible after seeing how the &quot;experts&quot; were willing to accept possible FTL and even had proposals to offer.</span>

<p>From my experience as a graduate student, it seems that researchers who are passionate about their work do approximately the same thing regardless of its <strong>supposed importance</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Here's what to do:</strong></p>

<p>(1) Write up your work as best you can while also discussing the ideas and concepts with your friends, collaborators, co-workers, etc.</p>

<p>(2) Promote your work to other researches, friends, collaborators, etc.  But, often people are busy so keep your expectations low and courtesy high.</p>

<p>(3) Pinpoint your audience and seek out the appropriate journals, workshops, and conferences to submit to.</p>

<p>(4) If you have any questions or concerns before submitting, contact someone affiliated with the conference.  I've had a positive experience doing this, but sometimes you get ignored.</p>

<p>(5) Be ready for rejection because you are more likely than not to get rejected (even if your results are important, actually especially if they are important).</p>

<p><strong>Remarks:</strong></p>

<p>(a) I like to think that the quality of reviews is associated with the clarity of the paper, but I've received some questionable reviews in the past that seem like scattered words that may or may not be related to my work.  Just don't hold a grudge and happily try again.</p>

<p>(b) If something's important to you and you're financially capable, then getting rejected once or twice is alright as long as you keep trying to improve your presentation and keep communicating with others.</p>

<p>(c) You don't want to go off the face of the earth and live like a hermit.  That's not going to help anyone and especially not you.</p>

<p>(d) Finally, be open minded.  People do make mistakes and sometimes the thing that caused the mistake is meaningful.</p>
